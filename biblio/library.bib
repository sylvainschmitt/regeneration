abstract = {Plants are enormously diverse in their traits and ecological adaptation, even within given ecosystems, such as tropical rainforests. Accounting for this diversity in vegetation models poses serious challenges. Global plant functional trait databases have highlighted general trait correlations across species that have considerably advanced this research program. However, it remains unclear whether trait correlations found globally hold within communities, and whether they extend to drought tolerance traits. For 134 individual plants spanning a range of sizes and life forms (tree, liana, understorey species) within an Amazonian forest, we measured leaf drought tolerance (leaf water potential at turgor loss point, $\pi$tlp), together with 17 leaf traits related to various functions, including leaf economics traits and nutrient composition (leaf mass per area, LMA; and concentrations of C, N, P, K, Ca and Mg per leaf mass and area), leaf area, water-use efficiency (carbon isotope ratio), and time-integrated stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation rate per leaf mass and area. We tested trait coordination and the ability to estimate $\pi$tlp from the other traits through model selection. Performance and transferability of the best predictive model were assessed through cross-validation. Here $\pi$tlp was positively correlated with leaf area, and with N, P and K concentrations per leaf mass, but not with LMA or any other studied trait. Five axes were needed to account for {\textgreater}80{\%} of trait variation, but only three of them explained more variance than expected at random. The best model explained only 30{\%} of the variation in $\pi$tlp, and out-sample predictive performance was variable across life forms or canopy strata, suggesting a limited transferability of the model. Synthesis. We found a weak correlation among leaf drought tolerance and other leaf traits within a forest community. We conclude that higher trait dimensionality than assumed under the leaf economics spectrum may operate among leaves within plant communities, with important implications for species coexistence and responses to changing environmental conditions, and also for the representation of community diversity in vegetation models.},

abstract = {In recent years evidence has been accumulating that personalities are not only found in humans but also in a wide range of other animal species. Individuals differ consistently in their behavioural tendencies and the behaviour in one context is correlated with the behaviour in multiple other contexts. From an adaptive perspective, the evolution of animal personalities is still a mystery, because a more flexible structure of behaviour should provide a selective advantage. Accordingly, many researchers view personalities as resulting from constraints imposed by the architecture of behaviour (but see ref. 12). In contrast, we show here that animal personalities can be given an adaptive explanation. Our argument is based on the insight that the trade-off between current and future reproduction often results in polymorphic populations in which some individuals put more emphasis on future fitness returns than others. Life-history theory predicts that such differences in fitness expectations should result in systematic differences in risk-taking behaviour. Individuals with high future expectations (who have much to lose) should be more risk-averse than individuals with low expectations. This applies to all kinds of risky situations, so individuals should consistently differ in their behaviour. By means of an evolutionary model we demonstrate that this basic principle results in the evolution of animal personalities. It simultaneously explains the coexistence of behavioural types, the consistency of behaviour through time and the structure of behavioural correlations across contexts. Moreover, it explains the common finding that explorative behaviour and risk-related traits like boldness and aggressiveness are common characteristics of animal personalities.},

@inproceedings{Orr2017,
abstract = {Synopsis Arnold's 1983 path-analytic paradigm, considering “morphology, performance, and fitness,” has been elabo- rated in several ways. For example, current versions recognize the level of “behavior” (including aspects of motivation) as a filter between performance abilities (only measurable if motivation is maximal) and fitness components. Performance abilities constrain behavior, but behavioral choices may shield performance from selection. Conceptual and empirical issues remain, such as the extent to which individual variation in lower-level subordinate traits (e.g., circulating hormone concentrations) might directly affect behavior, growth rates, sexual maturation, etc., rather than having effects only through paths involving some aspect of performance. Moreover, empirical studies have yet to encompass more than a few possible paths in a given system, in part because life-history researchers rarely communicate with those focused on performance. Most life-history studies ponder trade-offs associated with reproductive effort, but studies of locomotor performance (e.g., maximal sprint speed) have rarely considered trade-offs with reproduction. This lack of connection is surprising because both life history (e.g., clutch size) and locomotor performance (e.g., locomotor stamina) traits require allocation of energy and other resources, so trade-offs between these trait types may be expected. These perspectives and cultures could be bridged by a focus on the ability of organisms to perform components of reproductive biology (e.g., lactation performance could be studied in animals maximally “motivated” by manipulation of litter size or endocrine function). Alternatively, one could study impacts of reproduction on performance, as when bats and live-bearing fishes lose maneuverability during gestation. We also consider sperm performance in the context of the paradigm and illustrate that the paradigm can easily be utilized as a frame-work within which to consider key aspects of sperm biology.},

abstract = {Adaptive Dynamics is an approach to studying evolutionary change when fitness is density or frequency dependent. Modern papers identifying themselves as using this approach first appeared in the 1990s, and have greatly increased up to the present. However, because of the rather technical nature of many of the papers, the approach is not widely known or understood by evolutionary biologists. In this review we aim to remedy this situation by outlining the methodology and then examining its strengths and weaknesses. We carry this out by posing and answering 20 key questions on Adaptive Dynamics. We conclude that Adaptive Dynamics provides a set of useful approximations for studying various evolutionary questions. However, as with any approximate method, conclusions based on Adaptive Dynamics are valid only under some restrictions that we discuss.},

Here, we show how to use this type of data to decompose mean fitness into (1) the effect of the environment in which the population is transplanted, (2) the effect of the genetic composition of the population and (3) temporal adaptation, which measures how the population fits the environment at that time. We derive analytical results for the pattern of temporal adaptation and show that it is in general maximal in the recent past. The link between temporal adaptation and local adaptation is discussed, and we show when patterns of adaptation in time and space are expected to be similar. Finally, we illustrate the potential use of this approach using a data set measuring the adaptation of HIV to the immune response of several recently infected patients.},

abstract = {Gene flow is a fundamental evolutionary force in adaptation that is especially impor- tant to understand as humans are rapidly changing both the natural environment and natural levels of gene flow. Theory proposes a multifaceted role for gene flow in adap- tation, but it focuses mainly on the disruptive effect that gene flow has on adaptation when selection is not strong enough to prevent the loss of locally adapted alleles. The role of gene flow in adaptation is now better understood due to the recent develop- ment of both genomic models of adaptive evolution and genomic techniques, which both point to the importance of genetic architecture in the origin and maintenance of adaptation with gene flow. In this review, we discuss three main topics on the geno- mics of adaptation with gene flow. First, we investigate selection on migration and gene flow. Second, we discuss the three potential sources of adaptive variation in rela- tion to the role of gene flow in the origin of adaptation. Third, we explain how local adaptation is maintained despite gene flow: we provide a synthesis of recent genomic models of adaptation, discuss the genomic mechanisms and review empirical studies on the genomics of adaptation with gene flow. Despite predictions on the disruptive effect of gene flow in adaptation, an increasing number of studies show that gene flow can promote adaptation, that local adaptations can be maintained despite high gene flow, and that genetic architecture plays a fundamental role in the origin and mainte- nance of local adaptation with gene flow},

abstract = {We develop a unified framework for jointly defining population dynamics models and measurements taken on a population. The framework is a state-space model where the population processes are modelled by the state process and measurements are modelled by the observation process. In many cases, the expected value for the state process can be represented as a generalisation of the standard population projection matrix: each sub-process within the state process may be modelled by a separate matrix and the product of these matrices is a generalised Leslie matrix. By selecting appropriate matrices and their ordering, a wide range of models may be specified. The method is fully flexible for allowing stochastic variation in the processes. Process parameters may themselves be modelled as functions of covariates. The structure accommodates effects such as density dependence, competition and predator-prey relationships, and metapopulations are readily modelled. Observations on the population enter through an observation process model, and we show how likelihood functions can be built that reflect both demographic stochasticity (which appears in the state process) and stochastic errors in the observations. Parameter estimation and estimation of state process variables can be conducted using sequential Monte Carlo procedures. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Moorad2017,
abstract = {The unusually long lifespans of humans and the persistence of post-reproductive lifespans in women represent evolutionary puzzles because natural selection cannot directly favour continued living in post-menopausal women or elderly men. Suggested sources of indirect selection require genetic correlations between fitness and survival or reproduction at younger ages, reproduction in the opposite sex, or late-life contributions to offspring or grandoffspring fitness. Here we apply quantitative genetic analyses to data from a historical human population to explicitly test these evolutionary genetic hypotheses. Total genetic selection increased the male post-50 lifespans by 0.138 years per generation; 94{\%} of this arose from indirect selection acting to favour early-life fitness in both sexes. These results argue strongly against life-history models of ageing that depend on trade-offs between reproduction and late-life survival. No source of indirect selection for female post-50 lifespan was detected, deepening the mystery of why female post-reproductive survival persists. This result is probably due to recent changes in the genetic architecture of female lifespan, and it highlights the need for similar quantitative genetic analyses of human populations at other points along demographic transitions. Using a historical dataset, Moorad and Walling investigate possible selection for post-reproductive lifespan in humans, finding indirect selection favouring early-life fitness in both sexes, but none in females over 50.},

abstract = {The strong association observed between fire regimes and variation in plant adaptations to fire suggests a rapid response to fire as an agent of selection. It also suggests that fire-related traits are heritable, a precondition for evolutionary change. One example is serotiny, the accumulation of seeds in unopened fruits or cones until the next fire, an important strategy for plant population persistence in fire-prone ecosystems. Here, we evaluate the potential of this trait to respond to natural selection in its natural setting. For this, we use a SNP marker approach to estimate genetic variance and heritability of serotiny directly in the field for two Mediterranean pine species. Study populations were large and heterogeneous in climatic conditions and fire regime. We first estimated the realized relatedness among trees from genotypes, and then partitioned the pheno-typic variance in serotiny using Bayesian animal models that incorporated environmen-tal predictors. As expected, field heritability was smaller (around 0.10 for both species) than previous estimates under common garden conditions (0.20). An estimate on a sub-set of stands with more homogeneous environmental conditions was not different from that in the complete set of stands, suggesting that our models correctly captured the environmental variation at the spatial scale of the study. Our results highlight the importance of measuring quantitative genetic parameters in natural populations, where environmental heterogeneity is a critical aspect. The heritability of serotiny, although not high, combined with high phenotypic variance within populations, confirms the potential of this fire-related trait for evolutionary change in the wild.},

abstract = {Evolutionary theory predicts that local population divergence will depend on the balance between the diversifying effect of selection and the homogenizing effect of gene flow. However, spatial variation in the expression of genetic variation will also generate differential evolutionary responses. Furthermore, if dispersal is non-random it may actually reinforce, rather than counteract, evolutionary differentiation. Here we document the evolution of differences in body mass within a population of great tits, Parus major, inhabiting a single continuous woodland, over a 36-year period. We show that genetic variance for nestling body mass is spatially variable, that this generates different potential responses to selection, and that this diversifying effect is reinforced by non-random dispersal. Matching the patterns of variation, selection and evolution with population ecological data, we argue that the small-scale differentiation is driven by density-related differences in habitat quality affecting settlement decisions. Our data show that when gene flow is not homogeneous, evolutionary differentiation can be rapid and can occur over surprisingly small spatial scales. Our findings have important implications for questions of the scale of adaptation and speciation, and challenge the usual treatment of dispersal as a force opposing evolutionary differentiation.},

Observations of the population can be modeled as functions of true abundance with realistic probability distributions to describe observation or estimation error. Computer-intensive procedures, such as sequential Monte Carlo methods or Markov chain Monte Carlo, condition on the observed data to yield estimates of both the underlying true population abundances and the unknown population dynamics parameters.

Here, we extend the Bayesian application of nonlinear state-space modeling to sequential population analysis of age-structured data using a model formulation that allows for unreported catches and incidental fishing mortality. It is shown that, once a familiarity with the general-purpose Bayesian software BUGS is acquired, implementing a state-space model is a relatively simple task. Indeed, this application requires just 18 lines of code in its entirety and does not require the programmer to know the formulae for any prior density functions or likelihoods. Consequently, we suggest that this methodology may permit the implementation phase of nonlinear state-space modeling to be relegated, thereby allowing more effort to be devoted to the challenging issues of model checking, selection/averaging, sensitivity, and prior specification.},

abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of phenotypes among populations is of major importance for species evolution and ecosystem functioning. Dispersal has long been assumed to homogenise populations in structured landscapes by generating maladapted gene flows, making spatial heterogeneity of phenotypes traditionally considered resulting from local adaptation or plasticity. However, there is accumulating evidence that individuals, instead of dispersing randomly in the landscapes, adjust their dispersal decisions according to their phenotype and the environmental conditions. Specifically, individuals might move in the landscape to find and settle in the environmental conditions that best match their phenotype, therefore maximizing their fitness, a hypothesis named habitat matching. Although habitat matching and associated non-random gene flows can produce spatial phenotypic heterogeneity, their potential consequences for metapopulation and metacommunity functioning are still poorly understood. Here, we discuss evidence for intra and interspecific drivers of habitat matching, and highlight the potential consequences of this process for metapopulation and metacommunity functioning. We conclude that habitat matching might deeply affect the eco-evolutionary dynamics of meta-systems, pointing out the need for further empirical and theoretical research on its incidence and implications for species and communities evolution under environmental changes.},

abstract = {For a subdivided population the consequences of dominance and gene flow for the maintenance of multilocus polymorphism, local adaptation, and differentiation are investigated. The dispersing population inhabits two demes in which selection acts in opposite direction. Fitness is determined additively by two linked diallelic loci with arbitrary intermediate dominance (no over- or underdominance). For weak as well as strong migration, the equilibrium structure is derived. As a special case, a continuous-time continent-island model (CI model) is analyzed, with one-way migration from the continent to the island. For this CI model, the equilibrium and stability configuration is obtained explicitly for weak migration, for strong migration, for independent loci, and for complete linkage. For independent loci, the possible bifurcation patterns are derived as functions of the migration rate. These patterns depend strongly on the degree of dominance. The effects of dominance, linkage, and migration on the amount of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the degree of local adaptation are explored. Explicit formulas are obtained for D ( = x1x4 - x2x3) and r2 (the squared correlation in allelic state). They demonstrate that dominant island alleles increase D and decrease r2. Local adaptation is elevated by dominance of the locally adaptive alleles. The effective migration rate at a linked neutral locus is calculated. If advantageous alleles are dominant, it is decreased only slightly below the actual migration rate. For a quantitative trait that is determined by two additive loci, the influence of dominance on measures of differentiation is studied. Explicit expressions for Q S T and two types of F S T at equilibrium are deduced and their relation is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {We develop a systematic toolbox for analyzing the adaptive dynamics of multidimensional traits in physiologically structured population models with point equilibria (sensu Dieckmann et al. in Theor. Popul. Biol. 63:309-338, 2003). Firstly, we show how the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics (Dieckmann and Law in J. Math. Biol. 34:579-612, 1996), an approximation for the rate of evolutionary change in characters under directional selection, can be extended so as to apply to general physiologically structured population models with multiple birth states. Secondly, we show that the invasion fitness function (up to and including second order terms, in the distances of the trait vectors to the singularity) for a community of N coexisting types near an evolutionarily singular point has a rational form, which is model-independent in the following sense: the form depends on the strategies of the residents and the invader, and on the second order partial derivatives of the one-resident fitness function at the singular point. This normal form holds for Lotka-Volterra models as well as for physiologically structured population models with multiple birth states, in discrete as well as continuous time and can thus be considered universal for the evolutionary dynamics in the neighbourhood of singular points. Only in the case of one-dimensional trait spaces or when N = 1 can the normal form be reduced to a Taylor polynomial. Lastly we show, in the form of a stylized recipe, how these results can be combined into a systematic approach for the analysis of the (large) class of evolutionary models that satisfy the above restrictions.},

abstract = {The ability to migrate can evolve in response to various forces. In particular, when selection is heterogeneous in space but constant in time, local adaptation induces a fitness cost on immigrants and selects against migration. The evolutionary outcome, however, is less clear when selection also varies temporally. Here, we present a two-locus model analyzing the effects of spatial and temporal variability in selection on the evolution of migration. The first locus is under temporally varying selection (various periodic functions are considered, but a general nonparametric framework is used), and the second locus is a modifier controlling migration ability. First, we study the dynamics of local adaptation and derive the migration rate that maximizes local adaptation as a function of the speed and geometry of the fluctuations in the environment. Second, we derive an analytical expression for the evolutionarily stable migration rate. When there is no cost of migration, we show that higher migration rates are favored when selection changes fast. When migration is costly, however, the evolutionarily stable migration rate is maximal for an intermediate speed of the variation of selection. This model may help in understanding the evolution of migration in a broad range of scenarios and, in particular, in host-parasite systems, where selection is thought to vary quickly in both space and time.},

We reveal three groups of such habits, each corresponding to a cluster of personality traits, shown to be shared by creative artists and scientists. The first habit group “embrace the unexpected” corresponds to the character trait “openness to new experiences” and encompasses tendencies to go ahead without a plan, collect diverse experiences, and take risks. The second group “create conditions for creation” links to the personality trait “autonomous” and encompasses simple habits such as making empty time and carrying a notebook. The third class of habits “break away from dogma” links to the shared personality trait “norm doubting” and stands for a strong drive to escape from established systems and also occasionally destroy part of one's own work to break tunnel vision and start anew. Although personality traits are hard to change, the habits we found hint at techniques or skills that may be taught.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms.

We extend the current maximum likelihood approaches to allow the incorporation of sex- and age-dependent counts and provide an application to data from a population of Soay sheep living on the St. Kilda archipelago. We then empirically evaluate the performance and potential of the method by sequentially omitting portions of the data available. We show that the use of multivariate time series extends the power of the state-space modeling approach. The variance of measurement error was found to be smaller for males and the sex ratio of lambs to be skewed toward females and constant over time. Our results indicated that demographic parameters estimated using state-space modeling without relevant individual-based data were in close agreement with those obtained from mark-recapture-recovery analyses alone. Similarly, estimates of population size obtained when the corresponding count observations were unavailable were close to those from the entire data set. We conclude that the approach illustrated here has great potential for estimating hidden demographic parameters, planning studies on population monitoring, and estimating both historical and future population size.},

Migrating or dispersing offspring elsewhere is likely to decrease an individual's or its offspring's fitness, not to mention the intrinsic costs and risks of dispersal. Gene flow into a population can counteract gene frequency changes because of selection, imposing a limit on local adaptation. In addition, the migrant flow tends to be higher from densely populated to sparsely populated areas. Thus, although the potential for adaptation might be greatest in poor and sparsely populated environments, gene flow will counteract selection more strongly in such populations.

Currently, ecological models can only explain such limits if patches vary in quality, leading to asymmetrical dispersal, or if genetic variation is too low at the margins for adaptation. However, population genetic models suggest that the increase in genetic variance resulting from dispersal should allow adaptation to almost any ecological gradient. Clearly therefore, these models miss something that prevents evolution in natural populations. We developed an individual-based simulation to explore stochastic effects in these models. At high carrying capacities, our simulations largely agree with deterministic predictions. However, when carrying capacity is low, the population fails to establish for a wide range of parameter values where adaptation was expected from previous models. Stochastic or transient effects appear critical around the boundaries in parameter space between simulation behaviours. Dispersal, gradient steepness, and population density emerge as key factors determining adaptation on an ecological gradient.},

abstract = {animal physiological performance is highly polygenic and highly plastic, and the same is generally true for the many subordinate traits that underlie performance capacities. Quantitative genetics, therefore, provides an appropriate framework for the analysis of physiological phenotypes and can be used to infer the microevolutionary processes that have shaped patterns of trait variation within and among species. In cases where specific genes are known to contribute to variation in physiological traits, analyses of intraspecific polymorphism and interspecific divergence can reveal molecular mechanisms of functional evolution and can provide insights into the possible adaptive significance of observed sequence changes. In this review, we explain how the tools and theory of quantitative genetics, population genetics, and molecular evolution can inform our understanding of mechanism and process in physiological evolution. For example, lab-based studies of polygenic inheritance can be integrated with field-based studies of trait variation and survivorship to measure selection in the wild, thereby providing direct insights into the adaptive significance of physiological variation. Analyses of quantitative genetic variation in selection experiments can be used to probe interrelationships among traits and the genetic basis of physiological trade-offs and constraints. We review approaches for characterizing the genetic architecture of physiological traits, including linkage mapping and association mapping, and systems approaches for dissecting interme-diary steps in the chain of causation between genotype and phenotype. We also discuss the promise and limitations of population genomic approaches for inferring adaptation at specific loci. We end by highlighting the role of organismal physi-ology in the functional synthesis of evolutionary biology. complex traits; physiological genomics; QTL mapping; selection experiments; systems genetics WITHIN-SPECIES VARIATION IN whole animal physiological perfor-mance is typically attributable to the combined effects of allelic variation at many loci and environmentally induced variation occurring across all stages of development and even prior to conception. That is, physiological performance can generally be regarded as a classic quantitative trait. The same is generally true for the many subordinate traits that underlie whole animal performance capacities. For example, aerobic exercise perfor-mance in rodents is a function of the pulmonary, cardiovascu-lar, muscular, and neural systems, each of which comprises numerous components. For these reasons, quantitative genetics is well suited to the analysis of physiological phenotypes and can be used to infer the microevolutionary processes that have shaped patterns of trait variation within and among species. In cases where it is possible to identify allelic polymor-phisms at specific loci that contribute to variation in phys-iological traits, the tools and theory of population genetics can provide insights into the evolutionary processes that have shaped observed patterns of genetic variation within species (48, 185). In comparisons of homologous genes among species, analysis of sequence divergence and recon-struction of ancestral sequences permit inferences about historical pathways of molecular evolution (46). Moreover, ancestral sequence reconstructions provide a starting point for genetic engineering experiments that can provide de-tailed insights into the biochemical and biophysical mech-anisms that are responsible for evolved changes in molec-ular function (76, 77). Here, we review how genetic approaches can inform our understanding of mechanisms and processes in physiological evolution. We also review approaches for identifying genetic loci that contribute to variation in physiological traits, includ-ing both forward and reverse genetics approaches. We do not discuss evolutionary analyses in general, such as the use of phylogenetic comparative methods or ancestral state recon-structions of phenotypes (63, 121, 154); instead, we focus more specifically on how the tools and theory of quantitative genet-ics, population genetics, and molecular evolution can be used to shed light on the evolution of physiological and biochemical phenotypes.

The observation of local adaptation thus provides important insight into evolutionary processes and the adaptive divergence of populations. The detection of local adaptation, however, suffers from several conceptual, statistical and methodological issues. Here, we provide practical recommendations regarding (1) the definition of local adaptation, (2) the analysis of transplant experiments and (3) the optimisation of the experimental design of local adaptation studies. Together, these recommendations provide a unified approach for measuring local adaptation and understanding the adaptive divergence of populations in a wide range of biological systems.},

The value of the approach is demonstrated by a simulation study which shows substantial improvement in parameter estimation when site-specific census data are combined with demographic data. The multivariate normal approximation to a multi-state mark-recapture likelihood is evaluated, and the performance of a diagonal variance-covariance matrix for the approximation is also examined. The work is motivated by a study of great cormorants. Analysis of the cormorant data suggests that breeders survive better than non-breeders, and also that probabilities of recruitment to breeding have been declining over time for all the colonies of the study. Supplementary material, including notes on the computation of standard errors and extended simulation results, are available online.},

The state space approach allows for random variability in both the data (the measurement of relative biomass) and in annual biomass dynamics of the tuna stock.

Potential incident solar radiation (in­ solation) was estimated from a geographic information system to quantify microclimate affinities of these spe­ cies across north-and south-facing slopes. At the com­ munity level, leaf size and SLA both declined with in­ creasing insolation, based on average trait values for the species found in plots along the gradient. However, leaf size and SLA were not significantly correlated across species, suggesting that these two traits are decoupled and associated with different aspects of performance along this environmental gradient. For individual spe­ cies, SLA was negatively correlated with species distri­ butions along the insolation gradient, and was signifi­ cantly lower in evergreen versus deciduous species. Leaf size exhibited a negative but non-significant trend in re­ lation to insolation distribution of individual species. At the community level, variance in leaf size increased with increasing insolation. For individual species, there was a greater range of leaf size on south-facing slopes, while there was an absence of small-leaved species on north-facing slopes. These results demonstrate that analyses of plant functional traits along environmental gradients based on community level averages may obscure impor­ tant aspects of trait variation and distribution among the constituent species.},

Here we first elaborate a novel conceptual framework posing specific hypotheses and predictions about the environmental and ecological contexts underlying the contribution of ITV to community trait turnover. We then empirically test these predictions in understory herbaceous plant communities in a montane environment, for 3 functional traits (flowering phenology, specific leaf area and height). We found that different components of trait variation mapped onto different environmental axes, specifically reporting a greater contribution of ITV along non-climatic axes (e.g., soil properties, light) than along the main climatic axis (i.e., ele...},

abstract = {The impact of soil cover organization on the forest community was studied in a 19 ha tract at Piste de St Elie station in French Guiana. One hundred and ninety five species, each represented by at least 10 individuals, were chosen from records of the position, diameter at breast height (dbh) and precise identification by botanical sampling of 12 104 ligneous plants (dbh more than or equal to 10 cm). Spatial variations in the soil were mapped using the method proposed by Boulet et al. (1982). The soil mapping units corresponded to the successive stages of evolution of a currently unbalanced ferralitic cover. These stages described firstly the thinning by erosion of the micro-aggregate d upper horizon and secondly the mineralogical changes under more or less extended hydromorphic conditions. The degree of evolution of ferralitic cover is also related to the hydrodynamic functioning and chemical properties of the soil. Geological substrate, topography and slope have also been taken into account. Analysis of the influence of environmental variables on plant cover has been performed using the Ecological Profiles method and Correspondence Analysis (CA) of the table of ecological profiles. The forest community seems to be dependent on the soil and the topographical features that govern it. There are significant, exclusive soil-species links for each soil functioning mapping unit. However, the highest proportion of significant positive links is connected with a thick micro-aggregate d horizon (25{\%}). Several species are of real value as indicators and more particularly enable differentiation between the forest stands of typical ferralitic soil and the ones of thinned out, transformed and hydromorphic soils. The CA of the species by environmental variables matrices reveals two significant factorial axes. The first can be associated with the drainage mainly related to the thinning of the soil and the second with the hydromorphic conditions related to the topography. The vegetation ordination of the stands ({\textless}?{\textgreater} 0.25 ha) delimited in the various soil domains clearly shows that changes in ferralitic cover and in particular the transition from soil with deep vertical drainage to soil with superficial lateral drainage is accompanied by substantial changes in the forest community.},

abstract = {One of the fundamental challenges in ecology is to identify the signature of assembly mechanisms result- ing from patterns of community composition. For this purpose, the trait-based approach has promoted the analysis of functional trait distributions within communities. Until now, much attention has been paid to the design of appropriate null models and the definition of relevant functional metrics for infer- ring community assembly mechanisms from trait distributions. However, less consideration were given to the set of methodological choices preceding the statistical analysis – i.e. from designing a sampling scheme to measuring traits – and how likely they influence the conclusions drawn, as this may subject the analysis to methodological biases. In this regard, a comprehensive perspective on how the overall set of methodological choices influence the inference of community assembly mechanisms is needed. We extensively reviewed recent studies that have addressed animal and plant community assembly by applying a trait-based null model approach. We analyzed how the set of methodological choices in these studies depended on the mechanisms of interest and how they could influence the conclusions drawn by the authors. We found that methodological choices only weakly depended on the hypothesized assembly mechanisms studied by the authors, especially because the two main assembly mechanisms hypothesized, i.e. environmental filtering and limiting similarity, were often tested based on a common experimental design. In contrast, the detection of assembly mechanisms was strongly dependent on the sampling scale, the type of data, the origin of trait values and the delineation of the reference species pool, while less affected by the null model and the functional metrics chosen. These results underline plausible methodological biases in favor of the detection of certain mechanisms to the detriment of others. In addition, there was a significant relationship between the predominant mechanisms concluded by the authors and the type of organism used as biological model, suggesting either that the methodological choices depend on a common strategy used by the different authors when studying similar biological models, or that the methodological choices depended on certain particular properties of the organisms. From this extensive review, we highlight major conceptual and methodological issues that need to be addressed in trait-based null model approaches. We synthesize the methodological choices relevant to study several assembly mechanisms while minimizing methodological biases. We then derive practical guidelines and emphasize the importance of spatial structure in sampling strategy and null model design, because of the scale-dependent signatures of ecological processes.},

abstract = {Community assembly involves two antagonistic processes that select functional traits in opposite directions. Environmental filtering tends to increase the functional similarity of species within communities leading to trait convergence, whereas competition tends to limit the functional similarity of species within communities leading to trait divergence. Here, we introduce a new hierarchical Bayesian model that incorporates intraspecific trait variation into a predictive framework to unify classic coexistence theory and evolutionary biology with recent trait-based approaches. Model predictions exhibited a significant positive correlation (r = 0.66) with observed relative abundances along a 10 °C gradient in mean annual temperature. The model predicted the correct dominant species in half of the plots, and accurately reproduced species' temperature optimums. The framework is generalizable to any ecosystem as it can accommodate any species pool, any set of functional traits and multiple environmental gradients, and it eliminates some of the criticisms associated with recent trait-based community assembly models.},

abstract = {Leaf and fine root morphology and physiology have been found to vary considerably among tree species, but not much is known about intraspecific variation in root traits and their relatedness to leaf traits. Various aspen progenies (Populus tremula and P. tremuloides) with different growth performance are used in short-rotation forestry. Hence, a better understanding of the link between root trait syndromes and the adaptation of a deme to a particular environment is essential in order to improve the match between planted varieties and their growth conditions. We examined the between-deme (genetic) and within-deme (mostly environmental) variation in important fine root traits [mean root diameter, specific root area (SRA) and specific root length (SRL), root tissue density (RTD), root tip abundance, root N concentration] and their co-variation with leaf traits [specific leaf area (SLA), leaf size, leaf N concentration] in eight genetically distinct P. tremula and P. tremuloides demes. Five of the six root traits varied significantly between the demes with largest genotypic variation in root tip abundance and lowest in mean root diameter and RTD (no significant difference). Within-deme variation in root morphology was as large as between-deme variation suggesting a relatively low genetic control. Significant relationships existed neither between SLA and SRA nor between leaf N and root N concentration in a plant. Contrary to expectation, high aboveground relative growth rates (RGR) were associated with large, and not small, fine root diameters with low SRA and SRL. Compared to leaf traits, the influence of root traits on RGR was generally low. We conclude that aspen exhibits large intraspecific variation in leaf and also in root morphological traits which is only partly explained by genetic distances. A root order-related analysis might give deeper insights into intraspecific root trait variation.},

abstract = {Functional diversity is a component of biodiversity that generally concerns the range of things that organisms do in communities and ecosystems. Here, we review how functional diversity can explain and predict the impact of organisms on ecosystems and thereby provide a mechanistic link between the two. Critical points in developing predictive measures of functional diversity are the choice of functional traits with which organisms are distinguished, how the diversity of that trait information is summarized into a measure of functional diversity, and that the measures of functional diversity are validated through quantitative analyses and experimental tests. There is a vast amount of trait information available for plant species and a substantial amount for animals. Choosing which traits to include in a particular measure of functional diversity will depend on the specific aims of a particular study. Quantitative methods for choosing traits and for assigning weighting to traits are being developed, but need much more work before we can be confident about trait choice. The number of ways of measuring functional diversity is growing rapidly. We divide them into four main groups. The first, the number of functional groups or types, has significant problems and researchers are more frequently using measures that do not require species to be grouped. Of these, some measure diversity by summarizing distances between species in trait space, some by estimating the size of the dendrogram required to describe the difference, and some include information about species' abundances. We show some new and important differences between these, as well as what they indicate about the responses of assemblages to loss of individuals. There is good experimental and analytical evidence that functional diversity can provide a link between organisms and ecosystems but greater validation of measures is required. We suggest that non-significant results have a range of alternate explanations that do not necessarily contradict positive effects of functional diversity. Finally, we suggest areas for development of techniques used to measure functional diversity, highlight some exciting questions that are being addressed using ideas about functional diversity, and suggest some directions for novel research.},

abstract = {This study examined variation in leaf traits and water relations in 12 evergreen and semideciduous woody species that occur in both seasonal wet and dry forests in Costa Rica and compared intra-specific leaf-trait correlations to those found in inter-specific global studies. The following traits were measured in both forests across seasons for 2 years: leaf nitrogen (N), leaf carbon (C), specific leaf area (SLA), toughness, cuticle thickness, leaf thickness, and leaf lifespan (LLS). Leaf water potential (LWP) and water content (LWC) were measured as indices of plant available water. Canopy openness, soil moisture, and herbivory were also measured to compare environmental variation across sites. Although species contributed the greatest amount to variation in traits, season, forest, and their interaction had a large influence on patterns of intra-specific leaf-trait variation. Leaf traits that contributed most to variation across sites were C, LWP, leaf thickness, and SLA. Traits that contributed most to variation across seasons were leaf toughness, LWP, and LWC. Furthermore, leaf traits were more correlated (i. e., number and strength of correlations) in the dry than in the wet forest. In contrast to results from global literature syntheses, there was no correlation between LLS and N, or LLS and SLA. Both light and water availability vary seasonally and may be causing variation in a number of leaf traits, specifically those that relate to water relations and leaf economics. Strong seasonality may cause leaf-trait relationships at the local scale to differ from those documented in continental and global-scale studies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Abiotic factors such as climate and soil determine the species fundamental niche, which is further constrained by biotic interactions such as interspecific competition. To parameterize this realized niche, species distribution models (SDMs) most often relate species occurrence data to abiotic variables, but few SDM studies include biotic predictors to help explain species distributions. Therefore, most predictions of species distributions under future climates assume implicitly that biotic interactions remain constant or exert only minor influence on large-scale spatial distributions, which is also largely expected for species with high competitive ability. We examined the extent to which variance explained by SDMs can be attributed to abiotic or biotic predictors and how this depends on species traits. We fit generalized linear models for 11 common tree species in Switzerland using three different sets of predictor variables: biotic, abiotic, and the combination of both sets. We used variance partitioning to estimate the proportion of the variance explained by biotic and abiotic predictors, jointly and independently. Inclusion of biotic predictors improved the SDMs substantially. The joint contribution of biotic and abiotic predictors to explained deviance was relatively small ( 9{\%}) compared to the contribution of each predictor set individually ( 20{\%} each), indicating that the additional information on the realized niche brought by adding other species as predictors was largely independent of the abiotic (topo-climatic) predictors. The influence of biotic predictors was relatively high for species preferably growing under low disturbance and low abiotic stress, species with long seed dispersal distances, species with high shade tolerance as juveniles and adults, and species that occur frequently and are dominant across the landscape. The influence of biotic variables on SDM performance indicates that community composition and other local biotic factors or abiotic processes not included in the abiotic predictors strongly influence prediction of species distributions. Improved prediction of species' potential distributions in future climates and communities may assist strategies for sustainable forest management.},

As such, it has been widely used for screening purposes in crop science and community ecology. However, since its measurement is not straightforward, a number of estimates have been proposed. Here, the validity of the (SLA x LDMC)(-1) product is tested to estimate leaf thickness, where SLA is the specific leaf area (leaf area/dry mass) and LDMC is the leaf dry matter content (leaf dry mass/fresh mass). SLA and LDMC are two leaf traits that are both more easily measurable and often reported in the literature.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The relationship between leaf thickness (LT) and (SLA x LDMC)(-1) was tested in two analyses of covariance using 11 datasets (three original and eight published) for a total number of 1039 data points, corresponding to a wide range of growth forms growing in contrasted environments in four continents.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The overall slope and intercept of the relationship were not significantly different from one and zero, respectively, and the residual standard error was 0.11. Only two of the eight datasets displayed a significant difference in the intercepts, and the only significant difference among the most represented growth forms was for trees. LT can therefore be estimated by (SLA x LDMC)(-1), allowing leaf thickness to be derived from easily and widely measured leaf traits.},

abstract = {Plant functional traits capture important variation in plant strategy and function. Recent literature has revealed that within-species variation in traits is greater than previously supposed. However, we still have a poor understanding of how intraspecific variation is coordinated among different traits, and how it is driven by environment. We quantified intraspecific variation in wood density and five leaf traits underpinning the leaf economics spectrum (leaf dry matter content, leaf mass per unit area, size, thickness and density) within and among four widespread Nothofagus tree species in southern New Zealand. We tested whether intraspecific relationships between wood density and leaf traits followed widely reported interspecific relationships, and whether variation in these traits was coordinated through shared responses to environmental factors. Sample sites varied widely in environmental variables, including soil fertility (25-900 mg kg(-1) total P), precipitation (668-4875 mm yr(-1)), temperature (5.2-12.4 °C mean annual temperature) and latitude (41-46 °S). Leaf traits were strongly correlated with one another within species, but not with wood density. There was some evidence for a positive relationship between wood density and leaf tissue density and dry matter content, but no evidence that leaf mass or leaf size were correlated with wood density; this highlights that leaf mass per unit area cannot be used as a surrogate for component leaf traits such as tissue density. Trait variation was predicted by environmental factors, but not consistently among different traits; e.g., only leaf thickness and leaf density responded to the same environmental cues as wood density. We conclude that although intraspecific variation in wood density and leaf traits is strongly driven by environmental factors, these responses are not strongly coordinated among functional traits even across co-occurring, closely-related plant species.},

Here, we use data from a large-scale biodiversity experiment with 24 subtropical tree species to show that neighbourhood tree species richness generally promotes individual tree productivity. We found that the underlying mechanisms depend on a focal tree's functional traits: For species with a conservative resource-use strategy diversity effects were brought about by facilitation, and for species with acquisitive traits by competitive reduction. Moreover, positive diversity effects were strongest under low competition intensity (quantified as the total basal area of neighbours) for acquisitive species, and under high competition intensity for conservative species. Our findings demonstrate that net biodiversity effects in tree communities can vary over small spatial scales, emphasising the need to consider variation in local neighbourhood interactions to better under- stand effects at the community level.},

Variation in plant functional traits results from evolutionary and environmental drivers that operate at a variety of different scales, which makes it a challenge to differentiate among them. In this article we describe patterns of functional trait variation and trait correlations within and among habitats in relation to several environmental and trade-off axes. We then ask whether such patterns reflect natural selection and can be considered plant strategies. In so doing we highlight evidence that demonstrates that (1) patterns of trait variation across resource and environmental gradients (light, water, nutrients, and temperature) probably reflect adaptation, (2) plant trait variation typically involves multiple-correlated traits that arise because of inevitable trade-offs among traits and across levels of whole-plant integration and that must be understood from a whole-plant perspective, and (3) such adaptation may be globally generalizable for like conditions; i.e., the set of traits (collections of traits in syndromes) of taxa can be considered as " plant strategies.

Herein, I evaluate whether the economics spectrum idea can be broadly extended to water – the third key resource –stems, roots and entire plants and to individual, community and ecosystem scales. My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade-off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n*$\backslash$nEvidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients.

abstract = {Aim Our aim was to quantify climatic influences on key leaf traits and relationships at the global scale. This knowledge provides insight into how plants have adapted to different environmental pressures, and will lead to better calibration of future vegetation-climate models. Location The data set represents vegetation from 175 sites around the world. Methods For more than 2500 vascular plant species, we compiled data on leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf life span (LL), nitrogen concentration (N(mass)) and photosynthetic capacity (A(mass)). Site climate was described with several standard indices. Correlation and regression analyses were used for quantifying relationships between single leaf traits and climate. Standardized major axis (SMA) analyses were used for assessing the effect of climate on bivariate relationships between leaf traits. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to summarize multidimensional trait variation. Results At hotter, drier and higher irradiance sites, (1) mean LMA and leaf N per area were higher; (2) average LL was shorter at a given LMA, or the increase in LL was less for a given increase in LMA (LL-LMA relationships became less positive); and (3) A(mass) was lower at a given N(mass), or the increase in A(mass) was less for a given increase in N(mass). Considering all traits simultaneously, 18{\%} of variation along the principal multivariate trait axis was explained by climate. Main conclusions Trait-shifts with climate were of sufficient magnitude to have major implications for plant dry mass and nutrient economics, and represent substantial selective pressures associated with adaptation to different climatic regimes.},

abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is considered the major means by which plants cope with environmental heterogeneity. Although ubiquitous in nature, actual phenotypic plasticity is far from being maximal. This has been explained by the existence of internal limits to its expression. However, phenotypic plasticity takes place within an ecological context and plants are generally exposed to multifactor environments and to simultaneous interactions with many species. These external, ecological factors may limit phenotypic plasticity or curtail its adaptive value, but seldom have they been considered because limits to plasticity have typically addressed factors internal to the plant. We show that plastic responses to abiotic factors are reduced under situations of conservative resource use in stressful and unpredictable habitats, and that extreme levels in a given abiotic factor can negatively influence plastic responses to another factor. We illustrate how herbivory may limit plant phenotypic plasticity because damaged plants can only rarely attain the optimal phenotype in the challenging environment. Finally, it is examined how phenotypic changes involved in trait-mediated interactions can entail costs for the plant in further interactions with other species in the community. Ecological limits to plasticity must be included in any realistic approach to understand the evolution of plasticity in complex environments and to predict plant responses to global change.},

abstract = {Fire hazard reduction treatments are commonly applied to mixed-species coniferous forests in western Montana, USA, to modify fuels structures and alter the competitive environments of individual trees. An improved understanding of how competition can be measured and how it conditions individual tree growth is needed for projecting the development of these forests, with and without treatment. Numerous studies have evaluated how competition affects tree growth and many indices have been developed to quantify the competition an individual tree experiences. These studies suggest that no single competition index or a single class of indices is universally superior; indices perform differently according to forest type and forest conditions. We chose several widely used distance-independent and distance-dependent competition indices, and also derived anisotropic distance-dependent indices from estimates of light interception by tree crowns. We evaluated the effectiveness of these competition measures for predicting basal area increment (BAI) of Pinus ponderosa, Pseudotsuga menziesii, and Larix occidentalis in western Montana. The best distance-dependent competition indices explained a larger proportion of growth variation than the best distance-independent indices (64{\%} vs. 56{\%}). This result indicates that competition is an important growth determinant in these forests and that competition varies locally, with variable tree densities and relatively complex stand structures creating heterogeneous neighborhood conditions. Competition indices derived from light interception models were only weakly correlated with other indices and performed poorly in terms of predicting tree growth. This result accords with previous observations that competition for light is not the primarily growth limitation for trees in the semi-arid conditions of western Montana. More sophisticated light availability models could be used to better assess variability in light interception and its marginal contribution to predictive accuracy of radial tree growth. Diameter and distance-dependent BAI models were developed for growth prediction at the species level and for all species combined. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

However, a general picture of the relative extent of ITV compared to interspecific trait variation in plant communities is still missing. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relative extent of ITV within and among plant communities worldwide, using a data set encompassing 629 communities (plots) and 36 functional traits. Overall, ITV accounted for 25{\%} of the total trait variation within communities and 32{\%} of the total trait variation among communities on average. The relative extent of ITV tended to be greater for whole-plant (e.g. plant height) vs. organ-level traits and for leaf chemical (e.g. leaf N and P concentration) vs. leaf morphological (e.g. leaf area and thickness) traits. The relative amount of ITV decreased with increasing species richness and spatial extent, but did not vary with plant growth form or climate. These results highlight global patterns in the relative importance of ITV in plant communities, providing practical guidelines for when researchers should include ITV in trait-based community and ecosystem studies.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Functional traits have been extensively used to describe, group and$\backslash$nrank species according to their functions. There is now growing evidence$\backslash$nthat intraspecific functional variability, as well as interspecific$\backslash$nvariability, can have significant effects on community dynamics and$\backslash$necosystem functioning. A core hypothesis for the use of functional$\backslash$ntraits expressed as species means, that their intraspecific variability$\backslash$nis negligible compared with their interspecific variability, has however$\backslash$nbeen too rarely tested empirically. We then addressed four questions: Is$\backslash$nintraspecific functional variability across species ranges negligible$\backslash$ncompared with interspecific variability? Are the major resource$\backslash$neconomics trade-off and functional strategies robust to individual trait$\backslash$nvariability? Are species rankings or ordination robust across species$\backslash$nranges once considering intraspecific variability? Can species be$\backslash$ndiscriminated by their leaf traits?$\backslash$n2. Using an environmentally stratified sampling design within an alpine$\backslash$ncatchment, we collected five functional traits for 13 common plant$\backslash$nspecies with contrasting life histories and traits. Several populations$\backslash$nfrom a range of environmental conditions were then sampled for each$\backslash$nspecies across their ranges.$\backslash$n3. With an original combination of single-trait and multi-trait$\backslash$nanalyses, we highlighted a non-negligible contribution of intraspecific$\backslash$nvariability to overall functional trait variability (similar to 30{\%}).$\backslash$nAlthough not affecting general and well-known functional trade-offs and$\backslash$nstrategies, intraspecific functional variability had the potential to$\backslash$nalter species ordination and produced a functional continuum rather than$\backslash$na clear-cut species classification.$\backslash$n4. Deciding whether intraspecific functional variability can be$\backslash$nconsidered as negligible - species being represented by mean trait$\backslash$nvalues -, or not - species being represented by multivariate trait$\backslash$ndistributions -, is an essential question for multiple ecological$\backslash$nissues. However, this decision cannot be generic, but will depend on the$\backslash$nstudied system and selected traits and species, as well as on study$\backslash$nobjectives.},

Theory shows that coexistence requires substantial differences between species, but species-level data rarely provide evidence for such differences. Using data from forests in the southeastern United States, I show here that variation evident at the individual level provides for coexistence of large numbers of competitors. Variation among individuals within populations allows species to differ in their distributions of responses to the environment, despite the fact that the populations to which they belong do not differ, on average. Results are consistent with theory predicting that coexistence depends on competition being stronger within than between species, shown here by analysis of individual-level responses to environmental fluctuation.},

abstract = {We examined tree-soil habitat associations in lowland forest communities at Paracou, French Guiana. We analyzed a large dataset assembling six permanent plots totaling 37.5 ha, in which extensive LIDAR-derived topographical data and soil chemical and physical data have been integrated with precise botanical determinations. Map of relative elevation from the nearest stream summarized both soil fertility and hydromorphic characteristics, with seasonally inundated bottomlands having higher soil phosphate content and base saturation, and plateaus having higher soil carbon, nitrogen and aluminum contents. We employed a statistical test of correlations between tree species density and environmental maps, by generating Monte Carlo simulations of random raster images that preserve autocorrelation of the original maps. Nearly three fourths of the 94 taxa with at least one stem per ha showed a significant correlation between tree density and relative elevation, revealing contrasted species-habitat associations in term of abundance, with seasonally inundated bottomlands (24.5{\%} of species) and well-drained plateaus (48.9{\%} of species). We also observed species preferences for environments with or without steep slopes (13.8{\%} and 10.6{\%}, respectively). We observed that closely-related species were frequently associated with different soil habitats in this region (70{\%} of the 14 genera with congeneric species that have a significant association test) suggesting species-habitat associations have arisen multiple times in this tree community. We also tested if species with similar habitat preferences shared functional strategies. We found that seasonally inundated forest specialists tended to have smaller stature (maximum diameter) than species found on plateaus. Our results underline the importance of tree-soil habitat associations in structuring diverse communities at fine spatial scales and suggest that additional studies are needed to disentangle community assembly mechanisms related to dispersal limitation, biotic interactions and environmental filtering from species-habitat associations. Moreover, they provide a framework to generalize across tropical forest sites.},

abstract = {Global variation in total bark thickness (TBT) is traditionally attributed to fire. However, bark is multifunctional, as reflected by its inner living and outer dead regions, meaning that, in addition to fire protection, other factors probably contribute to TBT variation. To address how fire, climate, and plant size contribute to variation in TBT, inner bark thick- ness (IBT) and outer bark thickness (OBT), I sampled 640 species spanning all major angiosperm clades and 18 sites with contrasting precipitation, temperature, and fire regime. Stem size was by far the main driver of variation in thickness, with environment being less important. IBT was closely correlated with stem diameter, probably for metabolic reasons, and, controlling for size, was thicker in drier and hotter environments, even fire-free ones, probably reflecting its water and photosynthate storage role. OBT was less closely correlated with size, and was thicker in drier, seasonal sites experiencing frequent fires. IBT and OBT covaried loosely and both contributed to overall TBT variation. Thickness variation was higher within than across sites and was evolutionarily labile. Given high within-site diversity and the multiple selective factors acting on TBT, continued study of the different drivers of variation in bark thickness is crucial to understand bark ecology},

The models explained 33{\%}–59{\%} of the variation in radial growth of the two spe- cies. For both species, growth declined more steeply as a function of crowding than shading.

abstract = {Trait-based approaches have an increasingly dominant role in community ecology. Although trait-based strategy dimensions such as the leaf economic spectrum (LES) have been identified primarily at global-scales, trait variation at the community scale is often interpreted in this context. Here we argue from several lines of evidence that a research priority should be to determine whether global- scale trait relationships hold at more local scales. We review recent literature assessing trait variation at smaller scales, and then present a case study exploring the relationship between the correlation strength of leaf traits and their similarity in variation structure across ecological scales. We find that the correlation strength between pairs of leaf traits does not predict whether the traits respond similarly to different drivers of variation. Instead, correlation strength only sets an upper bound to the dissimilarity in trait variation structure. With moderate correlation strengths, LES traits largely retain the ability to respond independently to different drivers of phenotypic variation at different scales. Recent literature and our results suggest that LES relationships may not hold at local scales. Clarifying under what conditions and at which scales the LES is consistently expressed is necessary for us to make the most of the emerging trait toolbox.},

abstract = {Phenotypic traits and their associated trade-offs have been shown to have globally consistent effects on individual plant physiological functions1–3, but how these effects scale up to influence competition, a key driver of community assembly in terrestrial vegetation, has remained unclear 4. Here we use growth data from more than 3 million trees in over 140,000 plots across the world to show how three key functional traits—wood density, specific leaf area and maximum height—consistently influence competitive interactions. Fast maximum growth of a species was correlated negatively with its wood density in all biomes, and positively with its specific leaf area in most biomes. Low wood density was also correlated with a low ability to tolerate competition and a low competitive effect on neighbours, while high specific leaf area was correlated with a low competitive effect. Thus, traits generate trade-offs between performance with competition versus performance without competition, a fundamental ingredient in the classical hypothesis that the coexistence of plant species is enabled via differentiation in their successional strategies5. Competition within species was stronger than between species, but an increase in trait dissimilarity between species had little influence in weakening competition. No benefit of dissimilarity was detected for specific leaf area or wood density, and only a weak benefit for maximum height. Our trait- based approach to modelling competition makes generalization possible across the forest ecosystems of the world and their highly diverse species composition.},

abstract = {1. Plant interactions play a central role in regulating plant communities and this role can be altered by abiotic stress. With increasing stress, ecological theory predicts that the role of competition decreases whilst that of facilitation increases. Such predictions have been tested with short-term plant removal experiments using two distinct indices evaluating the role of plant interactions: the intensity (absolute impact) and the importance (impact relative to that of other abiotic constraints) of plant interactions. 2. Using data on individual tree radial growth from more than 17 000 forest plots covering the habitat conditions of 16 species in the Alps and the Jura mountains of France, we show that non-manipulative estimates of plant interactions provide an alternative to this experimental approach. We developed a Bayesian neighbourhood growth competition model to test theoretical predictions about plant–plant interactions with a much larger spatio-temporal scope and set of study species than classically used in experimental studies of plant–plant interactions. 3. Our analyses revealed that competition – measured as neighbours effects on adult tree growth – varies in importance but not in intensity along two major bioclimatic gradients (degree-day sum and water availability). Observed patterns of competition importance differed between shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant tree species. First, the mean importance of competition was found to be much higher for shade-intolerant species. Second, for shade-intolerant species the importance of competition remained high even at low crowding indices (i.e. at a low competitor density), whereas for shade-tolerant species competition only became important at high crowding indices. {\{}4.Synthesis.{\}} Our non-manipulative approach to the study of plant–plant interactions allows analysing interactions among many species over large climatic gradients. Our results clearly demonstrate that a quantitative estimation of density dependence effects is key to understanding how plant–plant interactions vary along abiotic gradients. Growth predictions derived from our model can easily be integrated with other results on tree regeneration and mortality in individual-based models to investigate how plant–plant interactions drive tree population and community dynamics under varying climatic conditions.},

abstract = {Community ecologists are active in describing species by their functional traits, quantifying the functional structure of plant and animal assemblages and inferring community assembly processes with null-model analyses of trait distribution and functional diversity indices. Intraspecific variation in traits and effects of spatial scale are potentially important in these analyses. Here, we introduce the R package cati (Community Assembly by Traits: Individuals and beyond) available on CRAN, for the analysis of community assembly with functional traits. cati builds on a recent approach to community assembly that explicitly incorporates individual differences in community assembly analyses and decomposes phenotypic variations across scales and organizational levels, based on three phenotypic variance ratios, termed the T-statistics. More generally, the cati package 1) calculates a variety of single-trait and multi-trait indices from interspecific and intraspecific trait measures; 2) it partitions functional trait variation among spatial and taxonomic levels; 3) it implements a palette of flexible null models for detecting non-random patterns of functional traits. These patterns can be used to draw inferences about hypotheses of community assembly such as environmental filtering and species interactions. The basic input for cati is a data frame in which columns are traits, rows are species or individuals, and entries are the measured trait values. The cati package can also incorporate a square distance matrix into analyses, which could include phylogenetic or genetic distances among individuals or species. Users select from a variety of functional trait metrics and analyze these relative to a null model that specifies trait distributions in a regional source pool.},

This study hypothesized that there is a within-species economics spectrum within the general spectrum in the evergreen sclerophyll Quercus ilex which dominates low resource ecosystems over an exceptionally wide range. An extensive database of foliage traits covering the full species range was constructed, and improved filtering algorithms were developed. Standardized data filtering was deemed absolutely essential as additional variation sources can result in trait variation of 10–300{\%},blurring the broad relationships. Strong trait variation, c. two-fold for most traits to up to almost an order of magnitude, was uncovered. Although the Q. ilex spectrum is part of the general spectrum, within-species trait and climatic relationships in this species partly differed from the overall spectrum. Contrary to world-wide trends, Q. ilex does not necessarily have a low nitrogen content per mass and can increase photosynthetic capacity with increasing foliage robustness. This study argues that the withinspecies economics spectrum needs to be considered in regional- to biome-level analyses.},

abstract = {Bark is crucial to trees because it protects their stems against fire and other hazards and because of its importance for assimilate transport, water relationships and repair. We evaluate size-dependent changes in bark thickness for 50 woody species from a moist forest and 50 species from a dry forest in Bolivia and relate bark thickness to their other bark characteristics, species life-history strategies and wood properties. For 71{\%} of the evaluated species, the allometric coefficient describing the relationship between bark thickness and stem diameter was significantly {\textless}1 (average 0{\textperiodcentered}74; range 0{\textperiodcentered}38-1{\textperiodcentered}20), indicating that species attain an absolute increase in bark thickness with increasing stem diameter but invest relatively less in bark thickness at larger diameters. We hypothesized that in response to more frequent fires, dry-forest species should have thicker barked trees. Contrary to this prediction, dry- and moist-forest tree species were similar in allometric bark coefficients and bark thickness. In both forest types, about 50{\%} of the species never developed bark thick enough to avoid fire damage to their vascular cambia. Recent increases in fire frequency and extent may therefore have potentially large effects on the composition of these forests. Within each forest, coexisting species displayed a diversity of bark investment strategies, and bark thickness of trees 40 cm stem diameter varied up to 15-fold across species (ranging from 1{\textperiodcentered}7 to 25{\textperiodcentered}7 mm). In both forests, sapling bark thickness was positively related to adult stature (maximum height) of the species, possibly because trees of long-lived species are more likely to experience fire during their life span, whereas for species that are characteristically small or short-lived, it may not pay off to invest heavily in bark and they may follow a resprouter strategy instead. Sapling bark thickness was not related to species' shade tolerance. Bark and wood traits were closely associated, showing a trade-off between species with tough tissues (high densities of bark and wood) on the one hand vs. species with watery tissues (high water contents of bark and wood) and thick bark on the other hand. Species with different bark investment strategies coexist in both the moist and the dry tropical forest studied. Bark and wood fulfil many functions, and the observed trade-offs may reflect different plant strategies to deal with fire, avoidance and repair of stem damage, avoidance and resistance of drought stress, and mechanical stability. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

Using extensive data sets of trait variation within species, across species and across communities, we analysed whether and at what scales leaf economics spectrum (LES) traits show predicted trait?trait covariation. We found that most variation in LES traits is often, but not universally, at high taxonomic levels (between families or genera in a family). However, we found that trait covariation shows distinct taxonomic scale dependence, with some trait correlations showing opposite signs within vs. across species. LES traits responded independently to environmental gradients within species, with few shared environmental responses across traits or across scales. We conclude that, at small taxonomic scales, plasticity may obscure or reverse the broad evolutionary linkages between leaf traits, meaning that variation in LES traits cannot always be interpreted as differences in resource use strategy.},

This study examined the degrees of increase in Narea in response to canopy openings as leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf nitrogen content per mass (N-mass) in saplings of eight deciduous broad-leaved tree species in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Five of the species were well-branched species with a large number of small leaves (lateral-growth type), and the other three species were less-branched species with a small number of large leaves (vertical-growth type). The degrees of increase in Narea were compared between the two crown types. In closed-canopy conditions, leaves of the vertical-growth species tended to have a lower LMA and higher N-mass than those of the lateral-growth species, which resulted in similar N-area for both. LMA increased in canopy openings in the eight species, and the degrees of increase were not largely different between the lateral- and vertical-growth species. On the contrary, N-mass was unchanged in canopy openings in the eight species. As a result, N-area of each species increased in canopy openings in proportion to the increase in LMA, and the degrees of increase in N-area were similar in the lateral- and vertical-growth species. Therefore, this study showed that the degrees of increase in N-area were not correlated with the crown architecture (i.e., the lateral- and vertical-growth types).},

abstract = {1. The complex structure of tree bark reflects its many functions, which include structural support as well as defence against fire, pests and pathogens. Thick bark, however, might limit respiration by the living tissues of the trunk. Nevertheless, little research has addressed commu- nity-level variation in bark thickness, and to the best of our knowledge, no one has tested multi- ple hypotheses to explain variation in bark thickness. 2. We conducted an extensive survey of bark thickness within and among species of trees in the tropical rain forests of French Guiana. Trunk bark thickness increased by 1{\AE}2 mm per 10 cm increase in stem diameter, and varied widely at all taxonomic levels. Mean trunk bark thickness was 4{\AE}5 mm(range: 0{\AE}5–29 mm), which was less that found in two Amazonian rain forests in pre- vious studies. This survey of bark thickness should be of use for forest management since tree survival through fire is strongly predicted by bark thickness. 3. We combined the survey data with multiple datasets to test several functional hypotheses pro- posed to explain variation in bark thickness. We found bark to provide an average of 10{\%} of the flexural rigidity of tree stems, which was substantially less than that found in the only other study of bark stiffness. Bark thickness was uncorrelated with species' association with fire-prone habi- tats, suggesting that the influence of fire on bark thickness does not extend into moist Forests. There was also little evidence that bark thickness is affected by its function as a defence against herbivory. Nor was there evidence that thick bark limits trunk respiration. 4. A re-analysis of previously collected anatomical data indicated that variation in rhytidome (non-conducting outer bark) thickness explains much of the variation in overall bark thickness. As rhytidome is primarily involved in protecting the living tissues of the trunk, we suggest that bark thickness is driven mostly by its defensive function. 5. Functional explanations for the variation in bark thickness were not clear-cut. Nevertheless, this study provides a foundation for further investigation of the functional bases of bark in tropi- cal trees.},

There is now an expanding set of applications for hypervolume concepts, as well as a growing set of statistical methods available to operationalize this concept with data. The concept has been applied to environmental, resource, functional trait, and morphometric axes and to different scales, i.e. from individuals, species, to communities and clades. Further, these shapes have been variously interpreted as niches, ecological or evolutionary strategy spaces, or proxies for community structure. This paper highlights these applications' shared mathematical framework, surveys uses of the hypervolume concept across fields, discusses key limitations and assumptions of hypervolume concepts in general, provides a critical guide to available statistical estimation methods, and delineates the situations where hypervolume concepts can be useful.},

abstract = {Comparative functional ecology seeks to understand why and how ecological systems and their components operate differently across environments. Although traditionally used in (semi)-natural situations, its concepts and methods could certainly apply to address key issues in the large variety of agricultural systems encountered across the world. In this review, we present major advances in comparative plant functional ecology that were made possible over the last two decades by the rapid development of a trait-based approach to plant functioning and prospects to apply it in agricultural situations. The strength of this approach is that it enables us to assess the interactions between organisms and their environment simultaneously on a large number of species, a prerequisite to address questions relative to species distribution, community assembly and ecosystem functioning. The trait concept will be first defined, before presenting a conceptual framework to understand the effects of environmental factors on plant community structure and ecosystem properties via plant traits. We will then argue that leading dimensions of variation among species can be captured by some selected traits and show that a combination of three easily measured traits—specific leaf area (the ratio of leaf area to leaf dry mass), plant height and seed mass—enables us to assess how different species use their resources, interact with neighbours and disperse in time and space. The use of traits to address central questions in community ecology will be reviewed next. It will be shown that traits allow us to (1) understand how plant species are sorted according to the nature of environmental gradients, (2) evaluate the relative importance of habitat filtering and limiting similarity in the process of community assembly and (3) quantify two main components of community functional structure, namely, community-weighted means of traits and community functional divergence. The relative impacts of these two components on ecosystem properties will then be discussed in the case of several components of primary productivity, litter decomposition, soil water content and carbon sequestration. There is strong support for the biomass ratio hypothesis, which states that the extent to which the traits of a species affect those ecosystem properties depends on the abundance of this species in the community. Assessing the role of functional divergence among species on ecosystem properties will require major methodological breakthroughs, both in terms of metrics and statistical procedures to be used. In agricultural situations, we show that trait-based approaches have been successfully developed to assess the impacts of management practices on (1) the agronomic value of grasslands and (2) the functional composition and structure of crop weed communities and how these could affect the functioning of the crop. Applications in forestry are still poorly developed, especially in temperate regions where the number of species in managed forest remains relatively low. The last decades of research have led to the constitution of large data sets of plant traits, which remain poorly compatible and accessible. Recent advances in the field of ecoinformatics suggest that major progress could be achieved in this area by using improved metadata standards and advancing trait domain ontologies. Finally, concluding remarks, unanswered questions and directions for research using the functional approach to biodiversity made possible by the use of traits will be discussed in the contexts of ecological and agronomical systems. The latter indeed cover a wide range of environmental conditions and biological diversity, and the prospect for reducing environmental impacts in highly productive, low- diversity systems will certainly imply improving our skills for the management of more diverse systems prone to a trait-based approach as reviewed here.},

Here, we examined: (1) how closely associated main stem and twig bark traits were, (2) how these associations varied across sites, and (3) used these associations to infer functional and ecological differences between twig and main stem bark. We measured density, water content, photosynthesis presence/absence, total, outer, inner, and relative thicknesses of main stem and twig bark from 85 species of angiosperms from six sites of contrasting precipitation, temperature, and fire regimes. Density and water content did not differ between main stems and twigs across species and sites. Species with thicker twig bark had disproportionately thicker main stem bark in most sites, but the slope and degree of association varied. Disproportionately thicker main stem bark for a given twig bark thickness in most fire-prone sites suggested stem protection near the ground. The savanna had the opposite trend, suggesting that selection also favors twig protection in these fire-prone habitats. A weak main stem-twig bark thickness association was observed in non fire-prone sites. The near-ubiquity of photosynthesis in twigs highlighted its likely ecological importance; variation in this activity was predicted by outer bark thickness in main stems. It seems that the ecology of twig bark can be generalized to main stem bark, but not for functions depending on the amount of bark, such as protection, storage, or photosynthesis.},

abstract = {Specific leaf area (SLA) is a key functional trait reflecting the trade-off between resource capture and conservation, and has been identified as playing an important role in plant community assembly. Mechanistic models of community assembly state that the assemblage of species in a local community is controlled by environment filters operating on functional traits. We measured within- and among-species variation of SLA, and environmental conditions in a tropical cloud forest to explore how variation in this functional trait contributes to community assembly. SLA variation at the species level was also decomposed into alpha (within assemblage variation), and beta (across assemblage variation) values. SLA decreased with increasing solar irradiance (approximated using plant height) within the three study sites, and differed among the three sites both for within- and among-species comparisons. Mean plot SLA, accounting for both within and among species across the three sites, increased significantly in relation to air temperature but not local photosynthetic photon flux density and soil total phosphorus. Alpha SLA decreased with increasing solar irradiance within the three sites and beta SLA differed among the three sites. Our results clearly demonstrate that light and air temperature are key environmental factors involved in organizing plant species within and among communities in tropical cloud forests. The strong relationship between both intra- and interspecific variation in SLA and environmental conditions strongly confirms the role of trait variation in the assembly of plant species in tropical cloud forest communities via environment filtering related to light availability and air temperature.},

abstract = {Plant communities have traditionally been viewed as either a random collection of individuals or as organismal entities. For most ecologists however, neither perspective provides a modern comprehensive view of plant communities, but we have yet to formalize the view that we currently hold. Here, we assert that an explicit re-consideration of formal community theory must incorporate interactions that have recently been prominent in plant ecology, namely facilitation and indirect effects among competitors. These interactions do not suppport the traditional individualistic perspective. We believe that rejecting strict individualistic theory will allow ecologists to better explain variation occurring at different spatial scales, synthesize more general predictive theories of community dynamics, and develop models for community-level responses to global change. Here, we introduce the concept of the integrated community (IC) which proposes that natural plant communities range from highly individualistic to highly interdependent depending on synergism among: (i) stochastic processes, (ii) the abiotic tolerances of species, (iii) positive and negative interactions among plants, and (iv) indirect interactions within and between trophic levels. All of these processes are well accepted by plant ecologists, but no single theory has sought to integrate these different processes into our concept of communities},

Here, we introduce a new hierarchical Bayesian model that incorporates intraspecific trait variation into a predictive framework to unify classic coexistence theory and evolutionary biology with recent trait-based approaches. Model predictions exhibited a significant positive correlation (r = 0.66) with observed relative abundances along a 10 °C gradient in mean annual temperature. The model predicted the correct dominant species in half of the plots, and accurately reproduced species' temperature optimums.

A new statistical model of trait-based environmental filtering can be a useful tool for exploring the logical consequences of this process while holding all other processes constant. The model uses the logic of objective Bayesian inference to compute the probabilities of species within different environments using two sources of information: the location and dispersion of species within functional trait space, and the statistical relationship between traits and environmental gradients. By varying key parameters in the model, we highlight several testable hypotheses for trait-based ecology. First, niche breadth decreases as intraspecific trait variation decreases, as the strength of the environmental filter increases, and if the trait values do not enhance fitness in any environmental condition in the landscape. Second, niche shape is determined by the form of the trait-environment relationships, where species with extreme trait values are predicted to dominate at the environmental extremes when traits are linearly related to the environment, species with intermediate trait values generally have a selective advantage across a broader environmental range, and bimodal species response curves can occur independently from negative species interactions. The generality of these modelling results can be tested using empirical data from any ecosystem.},

abstract = {Abstract. Links between plant traits and the environment, i.e. sets of plant attributes consistently associated with certain environmental conditions, are the consequence of the filtering effect of climatic, disturbance and biotic conditions. These filters determine which components of a species pool are assembled into local communities. We aimed at testing for consistent association between plant traits and climatic conditions along a steep regional gradient, divided into 13 climatically homogeneous sectors, in central-western Argentina. We analyzed 19 vegetative and regeneration traits of the 100 most abundant species along the gradient. For each trait, we tested for homogeneity of frequencies of different categories between sectors and the regional species pool, using the $\chi$2 statistic. We rejected H0 in 71{\%} of the pair-wise comparisons, which strongly suggests a ‘filtering effect' of climatic factors on key plant functions. Vegetative traits were filtered more often than regeneration traits. Specific leaf area, life span, ramification, canopy height, leaf weight ratio, carbon investment into support tissue and pollination mode were the traits showing differences in the largest number of pair-wise comparisons. This is probably the first attempt to detect, on a quantitative, statistically conservative basis, consistent linkages between climatic factors and numerous plant traits, over a broad spectrum of environmental conditions and plant growth forms. We discuss the advantages and limitations of this approach in predicting vegetation structure and functioning under present environmental conditions, and those expected for the next century as a consequence of global change.},

abstract = {Local species coexistence is the outcome of abiotic and biotic filtering processes which sort species according to their trait values. However, the capacity of trait-based approaches to predict the variation in realized species richness remains to be investigated. In this study, we asked whether a limited number of plant functional traits, related to the leaf-height-seed strategy scheme and averaged at the community level, is able to predict the variation in species richness over a flooding disturbance gradient. We further investigated how these mean community traits are able to quantify the strength of abiotic and biotic processes involved in the disturbance-productivity-diversity relationship. We thus tested the proposal that the deviation between the fundamental species richness, assessed from ecological niche-based models, and realized species richness, i.e. field-observed richness, is controlled by species interactions. Flooding regime was determined using a detailed hydrological model. A precise vegetation sampling was performed across 222 quadrats located throughout the flooding gradient. Three core functional traits were considered: specific leaf area (SLA), plant height and seed mass. Species richness showed a hump-shaped response to disturbance and productivity, but was better predicted by only two mean community traits: SLA and height. On the one hand, community SLA that increased with flooding, controlled the disturbance-diversity relationship through habitat filtering. On the other hand, species interactions, the strength of which was captured by community height values, played a strong consistent role throughout the disturbance gradient by reducing the local species richness. Our study highlights that a limited number of simple, quantitative, easily measurable functional traits can capture the variation in plant species richness at a local scale and provides a promising quantification of key community assembly mechanisms.},

abstract = {1. A fundamental trade-off among vascular plants between traits inferring rapid resource acquisition and those leading to conservation of resources has now been accepted broadly, but is based on empirical data with a strong bias towards leaf traits. Here, we test whether interspecific variation in traits of different plant organs obeys this same trade-off and whether within-plant trade-offs are consistent between organs. 2. Thereto, we measured suites of the same chemical and structural traits from the main vegetative organs for a species set representing aquatic, riparian and terrestrial environments including the main vascular higher taxa and growth forms of a subarctic flora. The traits were chosen to have consistent relevance for plant defence and growth across organs and environments: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, lignin, dry matter content, pH. 3. Our analysis shows several new trait correlations across leaves, stems and roots and a striking pattern of whole-plant integrative resource economy, leading to tight correspondence between the local leaf economics spectrum and the root (r = 0.64), stem (r = 0.78) and whole-plant (r = 0.93) economics spectra. 4. Synthesis. Our findings strongly suggest that plant resource economics is consistent across species' organs in a subarctic flora. We provide thus the first evidence for a ‘plant economics spectrum' closely related to the local subarctic ‘leaf economics spectrum'. Extending that concept to other biomes is, however, necessary before any generalization might be made. In a world facing rapid vegetation change, these results nevertheless bear considerable prospects of predicting below-ground plant functions from the above-ground components alone.},

abstract = {Summary: Current developments of diversity measures that consider that species are not equivalent, concentrate on how functionally or phylogenetically (dis)similar species are from each other (interspecific components). To assess the biodiversity of a community, few of the developed measures include intraspecific components, that is to say components that concern only the current features of the individuals of a species or the history of the species regardless of the other extant species of the community. A requirement for new developments in diversity indices could thus be to integrate both interspecific and intraspecific components. The objectives of our study are to introduce a parametric index of diversity (qH), expressed as an effective number of species, which satisfies this requirement, and to analyse the diversity of order 2 (2H). In the particular case of equal intraspecific components for every species, 2H is a simple function of Rao's quadratic entropy. We introduce our new index family and demonstrate that the vectors of species' proportions that maximize 2H are not necessarily unique and may have zeros (removing species). Then, we apply our index to two case studies: a theoretical example of phylogenetic diversity analysis; and a real data set on the changes in diet diversity of bird communities along an altitudinal gradient. Using a theoretical phylogenetic tree, we demonstrate that a maximizing vector for 2H can be associated with measures of species' phylogenetic originality. Applied to bird communities in Tarentaise Valley, France, 2H describes a decline in diet diversity with altitude due to a higher proportion of invertebrates in the diets of birds that occur where rocks replace deciduous and evergreen bushes and trees. Related to recent developments of diversity study made in the field of ecology, our approach has the advantages of integrating functional or phylogenetic intraspecific and interspecific components, and species' proportions (e.g. relative abundance or biomass), and of being applicable to many different data sets and objectives. Applied to both phylogenetic and functional diversity, our approach can help decisions when prioritizing conservation actions. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Trait-based studies have become extremely common in plant ecology. Trait-based approaches often rely on the tacit assumption that intraspecific trait variability (ITV) is negligible compared to interspecific variability, so that species can be characterized by mean trait values. Yet, numerous recent studies have challenged this assumption by showing that ITV significantly affects various ecological processes. Accounting for ITV may thus strengthen trait-based approaches, but measuring trait values on a large number of individuals per species and site is not feasible. Therefore, it is important and timely to synthesize existing knowledge on ITV in order to (1) decide critically when ITV should be considered, and (2) establish methods for incorporating this variability. Here we propose a practical set of rules to identify circumstances under which ITV should be accounted for. We formulate a spatial trait variance partitioning hypothesis to highlight the spatial scales at which ITV cannot be ignored in ecological studies. We then refine a set of four consecutive questions on the research question, the spatial scale, the sampling design, and the type of studied traits, to determine case-by-case if a given study should quantify ITV and test its effects. We review methods for quantifying ITV and develop a step-by-step guideline to design and interpret simulation studies that test for the importance of ITV. Even in the absence of quantitative knowledge on ITV, its effects can be assessed by varying trait values within species within realistic bounds around the known mean values. We finish with a discussion of future requirements to further incorporate ITV within trait-based approaches. This paper thus delineates a general framework to account for ITV and suggests a direction towards a more quantitative trait-based ecology. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

The sun-shade acclimation and plasticity of 16 functional leaf traits of 38 tropical tree species were studied in relation to their light demand, maximum adult stature and ontogenetic changes in crown exposure. 2. Species differed significantly in all leaf traits, which explained a large part of the observed variation (average R-2 = 0.72). Light had a significant effect on 12 traits and species showed a similar proportional response to light, indicating that the species ranking in trait performance is largely maintained in different light environments. 3. Specific leaf area, leaf nutrient content and chlorophyll : nitrogen ratio showed the largest plasticity to irradiance. These traits are important for maximizing growth in different light conditions because they are closely linked to the photosynthetic capacity and carbon balance of the plant. 4. Plasticity is generally thought to be greatest for pioneer species that occupy early successional habitats with a large variation in irradiance. This hypothesis was rejected because short-lived pioneers showed the lowest plasticity to irradiance. 5. An alternative hypothesis states that plasticity is largest for tall species that experience large ontogenetic changes in irradiance during their life cycle. Yet plasticity was barely related to adult stature or ontogenetic changes in crown exposure. Short-lived pioneers that experience consistently high light levels did have low plasticity, but shade-tolerant species that experience consistently low light levels had high plasticity. 6. Tropical rainforest species show a large variation in plasticity. Plasticity is a compromise between many factors and constraints, and all of these may explain the observed patterns to some extent.},

The hydraulic architecture of trees can limit their water relations, gas exchange throughout the crown of trees, the distribution of trees over different habitats and, perhaps, even the maximum height that a particular species can achieve. Parameters of particular importance include: (1) the vulnerability of stems to drought-induced cavitation events because cavitation reduces the hydraulic conductance of stems, (2) the leaf specific conductivity of stems because it determines the pressure gradients and most negative water potentials needed to sustain evaporation from leaves, (3) the water storage capacity of tissues because this might determine the ability of trees to survive long drought periods.

Here, we use spatially explicit, neighbourhood models of tree growth and survival for 19 tree species, a highly resolved molecular phylogeny and information on eight functional traits to quantify the relative efficacy of functional similarity and shared ancestry in describing the effects of spatial interactions between tree species on demographic rates. We also assess the congruence of these results with observed phylogenetic and functional structure in the neighbourhoods of live and dead trees. We found strong support for models in which the effects of spatial neighbourhood interactions on tree growth and survival were scaled to species-specific mean functional trait values (e.g., wood specific gravity, leaf succulence and maximum height) but not to phylogenetic distance. The weak phylogenetic signal in functional trait data allowed us to independently interpret the static neighbourhood functional and phylogenetic patterns. We observed greater functional trait similarity in the neighbourhoods of live trees relative to those of dead trees suggesting that environmental filtering is the major force structuring this tree community at this scale while competitive interactions play a lesser role.},

abstract = {Linking species and ecosystems often relies on approaches that consider how the traits exhibited by species affect ecosystem processes. One method is to estimate functional diversity (FD) based on the dispersion of species in functional trait space. Individuals within a species also differ, however, and an unresolved challenge is how to include such intraspecific variability in a measure of functional diversity. Our solution is to extend an existing measure to variation among individuals within species. Here, simulations demonstrate how the new measure behaves relative to one that does not include individual variation. Individual-level FD was less well associated with species richness than species-level FD in a single trait dimension, because species differed in their intraspecific variation. However, in multiple trait dimensions, there was a strong association between individual- and species-level FD and richness, because many traits result in a tight relationship between functional diversity and species richness. The correlation between the two FD measures weakened as the amount of intraspecific variability increased. Analyzing natural plant communities we found no relationship between species richness and functional diversity. In these analyses, we did not have to specify the source of intraspecific variation. In fact, the variation was only among individuals. The measure can, however, include differences in the amount of intraspecific variation at different sites, as we demonstrate. Including intraspecific variation should allow a more complete understanding of the processes that link individuals and ecosystems and provide better predictions about the consequences of extinctions for ecosystem processes.},

Using a large new unpublished database, we examine the variability of specific leaf area and other leaf traits, the relationships between them, and their ability to predict position on the resource use axis. Specific leaf area is found to suffer from a number of drawbacks ; it is both very variable between replicates and much influenced by leaf thickness. Leaf dry-matter content (sometimes referred to as tissue density) is much less variable, largely independent of leaf thickness and a better predictor of location on an axis of resource capture, usage and availability. However, it is not clear how useful dry matter content will be outside northwest Europe, and in particular in dry climates with many succulents.},

We extend these tissue-specific analyses of functional strategy towards a whole-plant approach by integrating data on functional traits for 13 448 leaves and wood tissues from 4672 trees representing 668 species of Neotropical trees. Strong correlations amongst traits previously defined as the leaf economics spectrum reflect a tradeoff between investments in productive leaves with rapid turnover vs. costly physical leaf structure with a long revenue stream. A second axis of variation, the ‘stem economics spectrum', defines a similar tradeoff at the stem level: dense wood vs. high wood water content and thick bark. Most importantly, these two axes are orthogonal, suggesting that tradeoffs operate independently at the leaf and at the stem levels. By simplifying the multivariate ecological strategies of tropical trees into positions along these two spectra, our results provide a basis to improve global vegetation models predicting responses of tropical forests to global change.},

abstract = {How large numbers of competing plant species manage to coexist is a major unresolved question in community ecology. The classical explanation, that each species occupies its own niche, seems at first unlikely because most plants require the same set of resources and acquire these in a limited number of ways. However, recent studies, although few in number and incomplete in many ways, do suggest that plants segregate along various environmental niche axes, including gradients of light, soil moisture and root depth, and that partitioning of soil nutrients occurs, possibly through the mediation of microbial symbionts, some of which are more species specific than was previously thought. Although it is unlikely that niche separation along environmental axes is the only mechanism of coexistence in any large community, the evidence now suggests that it plays a more significant role than has been previously appreciated. More research into the consequences of various known tradeoffs is likely to uncover further cases of niche separation facilitating coexistence.},

abstract = {In its simplest definition, a trait is a surrogate of organismal performance, and this meaning of the term has been used by evolutionists for a long time. Over the last three decades, developments in community and ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term “trait” itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the “performance paradigm” to plant ecology. “Functional traits” are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing “integration functions” which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.},

However, fundamental gaps remain in our understanding of how ITV contributes to mechanisms that create spatial variation in the functional-trait composition of communities (functional $\beta$-diversity). Importantly, ITV may influence the perceived importance of environmental filtering across spatial scales. 2.We examined how ITV contributes to functional $\beta$-diversity and environmental filtering in woody plant communities in a temperate forest in the Ozark ecoregion, Missouri, USA. To test the hypothesis that ITV contributes to changes in the perceived importance of environmental filtering across scales, we compared patterns of functional $\beta$-diversity across soil-resource and topographic gradients at three spatial grains and three spatial extents. To quantify the contribution of ITV to functional $\beta$-diversity, we compared patterns that included ITV in five traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf water content, leaf toughness, and chlorophyll content) to patterns based on species-mean trait values. 3.Functional $\beta$-diversity that included ITV increased with spatial extent and decreased with spatial grain, suggesting stronger environmental filtering within spatially extensive landscapes that contain populations locally adapted to different habitats. In contrast, functional $\beta$-diversity based on species-mean trait values increased with spatial extent but did not change with spatial grain, suggesting weaker environmental filtering among larger communities which each contain a variety of habitats and locally adapted populations. 4.Synthesis. Although studies typically infer community assembly mechanisms from species-mean trait values, our study suggests that mean trait values may mask the strength of assembly mechanisms such as environmental filtering, especially in landscape-scale studies that encompass strong environmental gradients and locally adapted populations. Our study highlights the utility of integrating ITV into studies of functional $\beta$-diversity to better understand the ecological conditions under which trait variation within and among species contributes most strongly to patterns of biodiversity across spatial scales.},

In addition, very little attempt has been made to examine whether the existence of LES depends on spatial scales. To address these questions, we quantified the variation and covariation of four leaf economic traits (specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus contents) in a cosmopolitan wetland species (Phragmites australis) at three spatial (inter-regional, regional, and site) scales across most of the species range in China. The species expressed large intraspecific variation in the leaf economic traits at all of the three spatial scales. It also showed strong covariation among the four leaf economic traits across the species range. The coordination among leaf economic traits resulted in LES at all three scales and the environmental variables determining variation in leaf economic traits were different among the spatial scales. Our results provide novel evidence for within-species LES at multiple spatial scales, indicating that resource trade-off could also constrain intraspecific trait variation mainly driven by climatic and/or edaphic differences.},

Topography and elevation influence vegetation across biomes in terms of species composition and assemblages. Topographical variables have been used to determine species richness, regional biodiversity patterns, forest health, species distributions and gradients of exotic species. Within the Western Ghats of India, the potential of geographic information systems and remotely-sensed data in characterising tropical montane forests (locally known as sholas) has been investigated. In this study, the influence of topographical variables in determining the presence of shola fragments was tested. A multiple logistic regression approach was used to predict presence or absence of insular fragments in the matrix of grasslands using elevation data. We observed that topographical variables significantly predicted whether the vegetation type was shola or non-shola. Of all the variables, aspect (as quantified in eastness and northness) strongly determined the presence of shola fragments whereas wetness index and curvature of slope influenced the results to a lesser extent. Positive correlation of wetness index with the presence of shola fragments suggested the maintenance of shola by hydrological regulation.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Intraspecific trait variability is a crucial, often neglected, component of functional diversity (FD) in ecological communities. In particular, uncertainty remains as to the importance of intraspecific variability in the quantification of FD. 2. To explore this uncertainty, we propose two methods addressing two critical and complementary, but largely unexplored, questions: (i) what is the extent of within- vs. between-species FD in different communities? and (ii) to what extent is the response of FD to environment because of compositional turnover vs. intraspecific trait variability across habitats? The methods proposed to address these questions are built on a variance partitioning approach and have the advantage of including species relative abundance, therefore taking into account species dominance and rarity. For each of the questions, we illustrate one dedicated case study in semi-natural grasslands with associated sampling strategies. 3. The decomposition of total community variance into within- vs. between-species effects can be implemented in a manner similar to the decomposition of quadratic entropy on pairwise individual dissimilarity. The approach can be applied with single and multiple traits, although it proves more informative for single traits. It can prove particularly useful when assessing the role of different sources of trait variability in the assembly of communities. 4. The assessment of the relative contribution of intraspecific trait variability and species turnover to the response of FD to environment is based on a variance partitioning comparing FD indices computed (i) either using individuals measured in a specific habitat alone (FDhabitat) or (ii) all individuals measured across different habitats (FDfixed). This approach provides a more complete understanding of the response of FD to environment. 5. We further propose a guide to apply these two methods and to choose the most suitable method for intraspecific trait measurements. Assessing the role of intraspecific trait variability should allow a more comprehensive understanding of the processes that link species and ecosystems.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Relationships between tropical rain forest biomass and environmental factors have been determined at regional scales, e.g. the Amazon Basin, but the reasons for the high variability in forest biomass at local scales are poorly understood. Interactions between topography, soil properties, tree growth and mortality rates, and treefalls are a likely reason for this variability. 2. We used repeated measurements of permanent plots in lowland rain forest in French Guiana to evaluate these relationships. The plots sampled topographic gradients from hilltops to slopes to bottomlands, with accompanying variation in soil waterlogging along these gradients. Biomass was calculated for {\textgreater} 175 tree species in the plots, along with biomass productivity and recruitment rates. Mortality was determined as standing dead and treefalls. 3. Treefall rates were twice as high in bottomlands as on hilltops, and tree recruitment rates, radial growth rates and the abundance of light-demanding tree species were also higher. 4. In the bottomlands, the mean wood density was 10{\%} lower than on hilltops, the basal area 29{\%} lower and the height:diameter ratio of trees was lower, collectively resulting in a total woody biomass that was 43{\%} lower in bottomlands than on hilltops. 5. Biomass productivity was 9{\%} lower in bottomlands than on hilltops, even though soil Olsen P concentrations were higher in bottomlands. 6. Synthesis. Along a topographic gradient from hilltops to bottomlands there were higher rates of treefall, which decreased the stand basal area and favoured lower allocation to height growth and recruitment of light-demanding species with low wood density. The resultant large variation in tree biomass along the gradient shows the importance of determining site characteristics and including these characteristics when scaling up biomass estimates from stand to local or regional scales.},

This simplification is only justified if interindividual niche variation is rare, weak, or has a trivial effect on ecological processes. This article reviews the incidence, degree, causes, and implications of individual-level niche variation to challenge these simplifications. Evidence for individual specialization is available for 93 species distributed across a broad range of taxonomic groups. Although few studies have quantified the degree to which individuals are specialized relative to their population, between-individual variation can sometimes comprise the majority of the population's niche width. The degree of individual specialization varies widely among species and among populations, reflecting a diverse array of physiological, behavioral, and ecological mechanisms that can generate intrapopulation variation. Finally, individual specialization has potentially important ecological, evolutionary, and conservation implications. Theory suggests that niche variation facilitates frequency-dependent interactions that can profoundly affect the population's stability, the amount of intraspecific competition, fitness-function shapes, and the population's capacity to diversify and speciate rapidly. Our collection of case studies suggests that individual specialization is a widespread but underappreciated phenomenon that poses many important but unanswered questions.},

This condition is, however, violated when autocorrelation is present within the data. In the case of variables that are regularly sampled in space (i.e. lattice data or images), such as those provided by remote-sensing or geographical databases, this problem is particularly acute. Because analytic derivation of the null probability distribution of the test statistic (e.g. Pearson's r) is not always possible when autocorrelation is present, we propose instead the use of a Monte Carlo simulation with surrogate data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The null hypothesis that two observed mapped variables are the result of independent pattern generating processes is tested here by generating sets of random image data while preserving the autocorrelation function of the original images. Surrogates are generated by matching the dual-tree complex wavelet spectra (and hence the autocorrelation functions) of white noise images with the spectra of the original images. The generated images can then be used to build the probability distribution function of any statistic of association under the null hypothesis. We demonstrate the validity of a statistical test of association based on these surrogates with both actual and synthetic data and compare it with a corrected parametric test and three existing methods that generate surrogates (randomization, random rotations and shifts, and iterative amplitude adjusted Fourier transform). Type I error control was excellent, even with strong and long-range autocorrelation, which is not the case for alternative methods.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The wavelet-based surrogates are particularly appropriate in cases where autocorrelation appears at all scales or is direction-dependent (anisotropy). We explore the potential of the method for association tests involving a lattice of binary data and discuss its potential for validation of species distribution models. An implementation of the method in Java for the generation of wavelet-based surrogates is available online as supporting material.},

Ecol-ogists need thus to find under which circumstances. Carlucci et al. (2015, this issue) bring new evidence on the importance of ITV for community assembly across a strong gradient. Sampling design may affect ITV quantification across gradients. Over the last years, growing evidence has accumulated on the fundamental role intraspecific trait variability (ITV) plays on ecological and evolutionary processes. Moving beyond the use of mean trait values may improve our understanding of processes acting within and among com-munities (Violle et al. 2012). However, given that (1) eco-logical field work cannot be exhaustive, (2) ITV generally contributes less to trait variance than interspecific differ-ences, and (3) ITV is rarely documented in trait databases, it has become critical to identify those circumstances under which ITV should not be neglected (Albert et al. 2011). Dealing with understory sapling communities across a canopy openness gradient in Brasil, Carlucci et al. (2015) bring new evidence to this debate. We may deplore that only specific leaf area (SLA) was measured, traits being known to be unevenly variable (Albert et al. 2010; Kichenin et al. 2013). However, they nicely explore the partition of variance both irrespective of community com-position and across the gradient, compare the response of the trait mean (CWM) and variance (FD), and compare the effect of ITV within (ITV within) and among (ITV among) communities. In this study, accounting for ITV enhances both mean plant responses and niche partitioning along the gradient. While ITV contributes less to trait variance than interspecific differences, it still disproportionately counts for revealing community patterns that otherwise could be misinterpreted (Jung et al. 2010). This reinforces the view that representing less than half of trait variation is not meaningful enough to serve as the criterion for decid-ing when ignoring ITV is reasonable (Albert et al. 2011). Four of their results are of specific interest. First, Carlucci et al. (2015) found ITV among to be much more important than ITV within for the variation in FD across the gradient. In previous studies a large part of ITV occurred within communities (Albert et al. 2010; Messier et al. 2010). We may thus wonder whether this reduced},

abstract = {* Despite recent progress in characterizing the within-species variability (WSV) of plant functional traits, the importance of this WSV in driving ecological processes such as leaf litter decomposability within species or at the whole community level is poorly understood. * We ask whether leaf and litter functional traits vary within species to form a spectrum of variability analogous to the leaf economics spectrum that occurs among species. We also ask whether this spectrum of trait variation within species is an important driver of leaf litter decomposability. To address these questions, we quantified both WSV and between-species variation of leaf and litter traits and litter decomposability of 16 co-occurring temperate rain forest plant species along soil toposequences characterized by strong shifts in soil nutrient status in New Zealand. * We found considerable WSV of both leaf and litter traits for all species, and a within-species spectrum of coordinated trait variation for 11 species. The WSV of leaf and to a lesser extent foliar litter C to N and C to P values were often strongly related to soil C to N and C to P ratios across plots. Further, in many cases, WSV and its covariation with species turnover contributed significantly to the community-level aggregate trait response to variation in soil fertility. * Contrary to our expectations, the WSV in leaf and litter traits did not generally predict within-species variation in leaf litter mass loss, nor N and P release, during decomposition. Further, inclusion of WSV did not improve predictions of leaf litter decomposability using community-level trait measures. * Synthesis. Our findings support the view that WSV of plant functional traits is an important component of plant community responses to environmental factors such as soil fertility. However, the apparent decoupling of WSV of leaf economic traits from WSV of ecological processes such as litter decomposability suggests that consideration of WSV may not be necessary to understand the contributions of trait variation to determining the breakdown of plant litter and therefore, potentially, ecosystem processes.},

The species tested represent a spectrum of regeneration patterns ranging from shade tolerant to light demanding. Overall, leaf optical properties of the four species were similar. Differences in absorptance were small, but statistically significant among the species and positions along the canopy gradient. Species absorptance differences corresponded somewhat to shade tolerance; two of the shade species showed higher absorptance in lower light environments, while the sun species showed the reverse pattern. Specific leaf mass (leaf weight per unit area) and chlorophyll content per unit leaf weight also changed along the canopy gradient. Specific leaf mass was positively correlated and chlorophyll per unit leaf weight was negatively correlated with increasing light environment. Consequently, the efficiency of absorption, as represented by the absorptance per unit leaf weight, increased as light level decreased. largely due to changes in specific leaf mass. In contrast, efficiency of absorption per unit leaf chlorophyll was relatively constant with light environment for the two species measured for chlorophyll.},

We present a trait-based approach that provides an additive decomposition of species' trait values into alpha and beta components: beta values refer to a species' position along a gradient defined by community-level mean trait values; alpha values are the difference between a species' trait values and the mean of co-occurring taxa. In woody plant communities of coastal California, beta trait values for specific leaf area, leaf size, wood density and maximum height all covary strongly, reflecting species distributions across a gradient of soil moisture availability. Alpha values, on the other hand, are generally not significantly correlated, suggesting several independent axes of differentiation within communities. This trait-based framework provides a novel approach to integrate functional ecology and gradient analysis with community ecology and coexistence theory.},

abstract = {I investigated the relationship between leaf physiological traits and decomposition of leaf litter for 35 plant species of contrasting growth forms from a lowland tropical forest in Panama to determine whether leaf traits could be used to predict decomposition. Decomposition rate (k) was correlated with specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) across all species. Photosynthetic rate per unit mass (Amass) was not correlated with k, but structural equation modeling showed support for a causal model with significant indirect effects of Amass on k through SLA, N, and P, but not K. The results indicate that the decomposability of leaf tissue in this tropical forest is related to a global spectrum of leaf economics that varies from thin, easily decomposable leaves with high nutrient concentrations and high photosynthetic rates to thick, relatively recalcitrant leaves with greater physical toughness and defenses and low photosynthetic rates. If this pattern is robust across biomes, then selection for suites of traits that maximize photosynthetic carbon gain over the lifetime of the leaf may be used to predict the effects of plant species on leaf litter decomposition, thus placing the ecosystem process of decomposition in an evolutionary context.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Trait-based approaches applied to community ecology have led to a considerable advance in understanding the effect of environmental filters on species assembly. Although plant traits are known to vary both between and within species, little is known about the role of intraspecific trait variability in the non-random assembly mechanisms controlling the coexistence of species, including habitat filtering and niche differentiation. 2. We investigate the role of intraspecific variability in three key functional traits - specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and height - in structuring grassland communities distributed along a flooding gradient. We quantified the contribution of intraspecific variability relative to interspecific differences in the trait-gradient relationship, and we used a null model approach to detect patterns of habitat filtering and niche differentiation, with and without intraspecific variability. 3. Community mean SLA and height varied significantly along the flooding gradient and intraspecific variability accounted for 44{\%} and 32{\%}, respectively, of these trait-gradient relationships. LDMC did not vary along the gradient, with and without accounting for intraspecific variability. Our null model approach revealed significant patterns of habitat filtering and niche differentiation for SLA and height, but not for LDMC. More strikingly, considering intraspecific trait variability greatly increased the detection of habitat filtering and was necessary to detect niche differentiation processes. 4. Synthesis. Our study provides evidence for a strong role of intraspecific trait variability in community assembly. Our findings suggest that intraspecific trait variability promotes species coexistence, by enabling species to pass through both abiotic and biotic filters. We argue that community ecology would benefit from more attention to intraspecific variability.},

abstract = {1. Trade-offs among functional traits reveal major plant strategies that can give insight into species distributions and ecosystem processes. However, current identification of plant strategies lacks the integration of root structural traits together with leaf and stem traits. 2. We examined correlations among 14 traits representing leaf, stem and woody root tissues. Traits were measured on 1084 individuals representing 758 Neotropical tree species, across 13 sites representative of the environmental variation encompassed by three widespread habitats (seasonally flooded, clay terra firme and white-sand forests) at opposite ends of Amazonia (French Guiana and Peru). 3. Woody root traits were closely aligned with stem traits, but not with leaf traits. Altogether leaf, stem and woody root traits delineated two orthogonal axes of functional trade-offs: a first axis defined by leaf traits, corresponding to a leaf economics spectrum, and a second axis defined by covarying stem and woody root traits, corresponding to a wood economics spectrum. These axes remained consistent when accounting for species evolutionary history with phylogenetically independent contrasts. 4. Despite the strong species turnover across sites, the covariation among root and stem structural traits as well as their orthogonality to leaf traits were strongly consistent across habitats and regions. 5. We conclude that root structural traits mirrored stem traits rather than leaf traits in Neotropical trees. Leaf and wood traits define an integrated whole-plant strategy in lowland South American forests that may contribute to a more complete understanding of plant responses to global changes in both correlative and modelling approaches. We suggest further meta-analyses in expanded environmental and geographic zones to determine the generality of this pattern.},

abstract = {The allometry of tree height with respect to trunk diameter and the allometry of trunk diameter with respect to distance from the top of the tree (i.e. trunk taper) were determined for 27 Robinia pseudoacacia trees differing in age and size growing in an open field. The allometric (scaling) exponent for height was {\textgreater} 1 for small and young trees and decreased to 2/3 and then 1/2 as tree size and age increased. Similarly, the exponent for taper was {\textgreater} 1 near the tips of young and old trunks and converged onto values of 2/3 and 1/2 toward the base of mature tree trunks. These observations indicate that a single 'optimal mechanical design principle' (i.e. elastic, stress or geometric self-similarity) neither holds true throughout the lifetime of R. pseudoacacia trees, nor does a single design principle govern the taper of a trunk throughout its entire length. Rather, over the course of growth and development, the allometry of R. pseudoacacia tree height and trunk taper progressively changes, complying with geometric self-similarity for young plants (and young portions of old plants) and subsequently giving the appearance of elastic or stress self-similarity as plants (or portions of plants) get older and therefore larger. Analyses of published (and new) data suggest that the conclusions drawn for R. pseudoacacia trees are likely to hold true for other tree species because stem growth in diameter is 'indeterminate' whereas growth in overall tree height is asymptotic and therefore essentially 'determinate'. {\textcopyright} 1995 Annals of Botany Company.},

abstract = {The issue of species delimitation has long been confused with that of species conceptualization, leading to a half century of controversy concerning both the definition of the species category and methods for inferring the boundaries and numbers of species. Alternative species concepts agree in treating existence as a separately evolving metapopulation lineage as the primary defining property of the species category, but they disagree in adopting different properties acquired by lineages during the course of divergence (e.g., intrinsic reproductive isolation, diagnosability, monophyly) as secondary defining properties (secondary species criteria). A unified species concept can be achieved by treating existence as a separately evolving metapopulation lineage as the only necessary property of species and the former secondary species criteria as different lines of evidence (operational criteria) relevant to assessing lineage separation. This unified concept of species has several consequences for species delimitation, including the following: First, the issues of species conceptualization and species delimitation are clearly separated; the former secondary species criteria are no longer considered relevant to species conceptualization but only to species delimitation. Second, all of the properties formerly treated as secondary species criteria are relevant to species delimitation to the extent that they provide evidence of lineage separation. Third, the presence of any one of the properties (if appropriately interpreted) is evidence for the existence of a species, though more properties and thus more lines of evidence are associated with a higher degree of corroboration. Fourth, and perhaps most significantly, a unified species concept shifts emphasis away from the traditional species criteria, encouraging biologists to develop new methods of species delimitation that are not tied to those properties.},

abstract = {Ecological communities and their response to environmental gradients are increasingly being described by various measures of trait composition. Aggregated trait averages (i.e. averages of trait values of constituent species, weighted by species proportions) are popular indices reflecting the functional characteristics of locally dominant species. Because the variation of these indices along environmental gradients can be caused by both species turnover and intraspecific trait variability, it is necessary to disentangle the role of both components to community variability. For quantitative traits, trait averages can be calculated from ‘fixed' trait values (i.e. a single mean trait value for individual species used for all habitats where the species is found) or trait values for individual species specific to each plot, or habitat, where the species is found. Changes in fixed averages across environments reflect species turnover, while changes in specific traits reflect both species turnover and within-species variability in traits. Here we suggest a practical method (accompanied by a set of R functions) that, by combining ‘fixed' and ‘specific averages', disentangles the effect of species turnover, intraspecific trait variability, and their covariation. These effects can be further decomposed into parts ascribed to individual explanatory variables (i.e. treatments or environmental gradients considered). The method is illustrated with a case study from a factorial mowing and fertilization experiment in a meadow in South Bohemia. Results show that the variability decomposition differs markedly among traits studied (height, Specific Leaf Area, Leaf N, P, C concentrations, leaf and stem dry matter content), both according to the relative importance of species turnover and intraspecific variability, and also according to their response to experimental factors. Both the effect of intraspecific trait variability and species turnover must be taken into account when assessing the functional role of community trait structure. Neglecting intraspecific trait variability across habitats often results in underestimating the response of communities to environmental changes.},

The objectives of this study were to (1) develop a theoretical framework for linking flower size and leaf size to their costs and benefits, as assessed using foliar stable carbon isotope ratio (delta(13)C) under varying degrees of water limitation, and then (2) examine how variation in flower size within and among species growing along a naturally occurring moisture availability gradient correlates with variation in delta(13)C and leaf size. Five plant species were examined at three sites in Oregon. Intra- and inter-specific patterns of flower size in relation to moisture availability were the same: the ratios of the area of flower display to total leaf area and of individual flower area to leaf area were greater at sites with more soil moisture compared to those sites with less soil moisture. The increase in flower area per unit increase in leaf area was greater at sites with more soil moisture than at sites where water deficit can occur. Values of delta(13)C, an index of water-use efficiency, were greater for plants with larger floral size. The patterns we observed generalize across species, irrespective of overall plant morphology or pollination system. These correlations between flower size, moisture availability, and delta(13)C suggest that water loss from flowers can influence leaf responses to the environment, which in turn may indirectly mediate an effect on flower size.},

abstract = {The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

abstract = {Owing to the conceptual complexity of functional diversity (FD), a multitude of different methods are available for measuring it, with most being operational at only a small range of spatial scales. This causes uncertainty in ecological interpretations and limits the potential to generalize findings across studies or compare patterns across scales. We solve this problem by providing a unified framework expanding on and integrating existing approaches. The framework, based on trait probability density (TPD), is the first to fully implement the Hutchinsonian concept of the niche as a probabilistic hypervolume in estimating FD. This novel approach could revolutionize FD-based research by allowing quantification of the various FD components from organismal to macroecological scales, and allowing seamless transitions between scales. Functional trait diversity, in other words the variation of traits between organisms, can be used to address a great number of pressing ecological questions. Consequently, trait-based approaches are increasingly being used by ecologists.However, functional diversity comprises several components that can be evaluated at different spatial scales. Because of this conceptual complexity, there is an overabundance of disparate approaches for estimating it, which leads to confusion among users and hampers the comparability of different studies.A single mathematical framework encompassing different approaches while providing a seamless continuity between spatial scales is needed.Reconciling the approaches based on the concept of the niche as a hypervolume and those that consider traits in probabilistic terms is the first step towards the foundation of a unified framework.},

Analyses of the distributions of functional traits can provide insight into the community structure generated by these processes. We predicted the trait distributions expected under the ecological processes of niche differentiation and environmental filtering, then tested these predictions with a dataset of 4672 trees located in nine 1-ha plots of tropical rain forest in French Guiana. Five traits related to leaf function (foliar N concentration, chlorophyll content, toughness, tissue density and specific leaf area), and three traits related to stem function (trunk sapwood density, branch sapwood density, and trunk bark thickness), as well as laminar surface area, were measured on every individual tree. There was far more evidence for environmental filtering than for niche differentiation in these forests. Furthermore, we contrasted results from species-mean and individual-level trait values. Analyses that took within-species trait variation into account were far more sensitive indicators of niche differentiation and ecological filtering. Species-mean analyses, by contrast, may underestimate the effects of ecological processes on community assembly. Environmental filtering appeared somewhat more intense on leaf traits than on stem traits, whereas niche differentiation affected neither strongly. By accounting for within-species trait variation, we were able to more properly consider the ecological interactions among individual trees and between individual trees and their environment. In so doing, our results suggest that the ecological processes of niche differentiation and environmental filtering may be more pervasive than previously believed.},

abstract = {Variation in angiosperm vessel diameter is of major functional significance. In the light of recent models predicting optimal vessel taper given resistance imposed by conductive path length, we tested the prediction that plant size should predict vessel diameter, with dryland plants having narrower vessels for their stem sizes. We assembled a comparative dataset including vessel and stem diameter measurements from 237 species from over 40 angiosperm orders across a wide range of habits and habitats. Stem diameter predicted vessel diameter across self-supporting plants (slope 0.36, 95{\%} CI 0.32-0.39). Samples from 142 species from five communities of differing water availability showed no tendency for dryland plants to have narrower vessels. Predictable relationships between vessel diameter and stem diameter mirrored predictable relationships between stem length and diameter across self-supporting species. That vessels are proportional to stem diameter and stem diameter is proportional to stem length suggests that taper in relation to conductive path length gives rise to the vessel diameter-stem diameter relationship. In turn, plant size is related to climate, leading indirectly to the vessel-climate relationship: vessels are likely narrower in drier communities because dryland plants are on average smaller, not because they have narrow vessels for their stem sizes.},

abstract = {We surveyed the literature published since 1985 for evidence of natural selection and heritability in vegetative functional traits and performance. Our goals were to (1) review patterns of selection on specific functional traits and (2) assess general evolutionary questions about selection and heritability for broad classes of traits. While generalizations about the functional significance of specific traits are premature, several functional hypotheses are supported. For example, herbivores can exert strong selection on secondary chemistry and mechanical defenses, but costs of resistance and negative correlations between defense traits may constrain their evolution. Competitive interactions select for early germination and favor stem elongation and shifts in flowering time where such responses actually minimize competitive effects. In the very few studies of physiology, selection on gas exchange and leaf size is clearly environment dependent. More generally, in reciprocal transplant experiments, populations often are locally adapted, and selection favors the native phenotype. These results suggest that selection is important in functional trait evolution and population differentiation. At the same time, selection often varies in space and time and across life-history episodes. This variation could slow the rate of evolutionary change, maintain genetic variation within populations, and select for plasticity. Analyses of general questions revealed that indirect selection through correlated characters accounts for a substantial portion of total selection on traits and often appears to reinforce the pattern of direct selection. This could be due to environmental effects on multiple phenotypic traits and fitness. Alternatively, indirect selection could contribute to the rapid evolution of suites of traits. We found only weak evidence that traits under strong selection have low heritability, a pattern that has been reported for animals and predicted by some theory. Thus, the rate of evolutionary change may well differ among traits. The strength of selection also depended on the fitness measure, being stronger selection through cumulative fitness than fertility or vegetative performance. Attributes of species' biology and experimental design affected selection and heritability estimates. Heritability was lower in inbreeding species relative to outbreeders, as expected. Heritabilities in controlled environments substantially overestimate estimates from the wild and should not be used as reliable predictors of the rate of adaptive evolutionary change in natural populations. Likewise, broad-sense heritability overestimates narrow-sense heritability and is thus unreliable for predicting evolutionary change in outbreeding species. Future studies of functional trait evolution should focus on physiology and a broader array of phenological and developmental traits. Long-lived species are severely underrepresented in microevolutionary studies, no doubt for practical reasons. Finally, an emphasis should be placed on exploring the nature and effect of trait interactions on fitness, since these are likely to be very important in shaping the course of evolution.},

abstract = {1.Plant phenotypic diversity is shaped by the interplay of trade-offs and constraints in evolution. Closely integrated groups of traits (i.e. trait dimensions) are used to classify plant phenotypic diversity into plant strategies, but we do not know the degree of interdependence among trait dimensions. To assess how selection has shaped the phenotypic space, we examine whether trait dimensions are independent.2.We gathered data on saplings of 24 locally coexisting tree species in a temperate forest, and examined the correlation structure of 20 leaf, branch, stem and root traits. These traits fall into three well-established trait dimensions (the leaf economic spectrum, the wood spectrum, and Corner's Rules) that characterize vital plant functions: resource acquisition, sap transport, mechanical support and canopy architecture. Using ordinations, network analyses and Mantel tests, we tested whether the sapling phenotype of these tree species is organized along independent trait dimensions.3.Across species, the sapling phenotype is not structured into clear trait dimensions. The trait relationships defining the trait dimensions are weak and do not dominate the correlation structure of the sapling phenotype as a whole. Instead traits from the three commonly recognized trait dimensions are organized into an integrated trait network. The effect of phylogeny on trait correlations is minimal.4.Our results indicate that trait dimensions apparent in broad-based interspecific surveys do not hold up among locally coexisting species. Furthermore, architectural traits appear central to the phenotypic network, suggesting a pivotal role for branching architecture in linking resource acquisition, mechanical support and hydraulic functions.5.Synthesis. Our study indicates that local and global patterns of phenotypic integration differ and calls into question the use of trait dimensions at local scales. We propose that a network approach to assessing plant function more effectively reflects the multiple trade-offs and constraints shaping the phenotype in locally co-occurring species.This article is protected by copyright.

Previously we found that Australian perennial species from low-rainfall sites had c. 40{\%} shorter LL at a given LMA than high-rainfall species. • Here we relate indices of leaf strength (work to shear, W shear, and tissue toughness) to LL and LMA across the same suite of species. W shear is the work required to cut a leaf with a blade; W shear divided by leaf thickness gives tissue toughness. • Low- and high-rainfall species did not differ in their LL at a given W shear, but dry-site species had lower W shear at a given LMA, leading to the observed LL - LMA shift with rainfall. These patterns were driven by 50{\%} lower tissue toughness in dry-site species. • The lower toughness was linked with high leaf N concentration, which is known to enhance water conservation during photosynthesis in low-rainfall species. Our results suggest that a significant cost of this strategy is reduced LL for a given investment in leaf tissue (LMA).},

Wood anatomical studies frequently provide several quantitative details of these cells, such as vessel diameter, vessel density, vessel element length, and tracheid length, while important information on the three dimensional structure of the hydraulic network is not considered. This paper aims to provide an overview of various techniques, although there is no standard protocol to quantify conduits due to high anatomical variation and a wide range of techniques available. Despite recent progress in image analysis programs and automated methods for measuring cell dimensions, density, and spatial distribution, various characters remain time-consuming and tedious. Quantification of vessels and tracheids is not only important to better understand functional adaptations of tracheary elements to environment parameters, but will also be essential for linking wood anatomy with other fields such as wood development, xylem physiology, palaeobotany, and dendrochronology.},

@article{Aarssen1983,
abstract = {The common assumption that species coexistence in nature can be generally explained by processes of natural selection for niche differentiation does not have strong empirical support for plants. The meaning of competitive ability has traditionally been embedded within an Eltonian view of the niche. In particular reference to plants, however, a true distinction between the meanings of niche and competitive ability is established based on the premise that for one species to competitively exclude another, two distinct conditions must be satisfied: (1) There must be a sufficient degree of overlap in the niche requirements of the two species; and (2) one species must be sufficiently superior at reducing the availability of resources to the other. Following these considerations an evolutionary theory of coexistence is proposed involving two alternative mechanisms based on a broader interpretation of the operation of natural selection in systems of competition than previously recognized. Competitive exclusion may be avoided either if natural selection results in niche differentiation (selection for ecological combining ability), or if reciprocal selection maintains a balance of competitive abilities (selection for competitive combining ability). Competitive combining ability, although previously overlooked, has wide applicability to plants for which coexistence frequently is explained incompletely by ecological combining ability. The main argument is as follows: All biological attributes of a species will play a part in determining its niche requirements on the one hand, and its relative competitive ability for those requirements on the other. Given the assumption that niche requirements generally overlap broadly in plants, I propose that coexistence is permitted because there are numerous possible permutations and combinations of biological attributes in plants which are roughly equivalent in the overall competitive power which they confer. In selection for competitive combining ability, these attribute complexes are continually adjusted in an ongoing process of coevolution in which local neighborhoods are constantly engaged in a fine-tuning process that alters the way members respond to one another. Consequently, natural selection ultimately maintains a balance of overall relative competitive abilities between two species for essentially the same contested resources. I discuss the relevance of this mechanism and its relationship to other theories and concepts associated with coexistence in contexts of competition. It is proposed that, in nature, selection for ecological combining ability and selection for competitive combining ability operate in concert, and this provides reconciliation of the contradiction in theory between convergent adaptation to a common habitat and divergent adaptation to other members of the community.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: When ecologically important plant traits are correlated they may be said to constitute an ecological 'strategy' dimension. Through identifying these dimensions and understanding their inter-relationships we gain insight into why particular trait combinations are favoured over others and into the implications of trait differences among species. Here we investigated relationships among several traits, and thus the strategy dimensions they represented, across 2134 woody species from seven Neotropical forests. METHODS: Six traits were studied: specific leaf area (SLA), the average size of leaves, seed and fruit, typical maximum plant height, and wood density (WD). Trait relationships were quantified across species at each individual forest as well as across the dataset as a whole. 'Phylogenetic' analyses were used to test for correlations among evolutionary trait-divergences and to ascertain whether interspecific relationships were biased by strong taxonomic patterning in the traits. KEY RESULTS: The interspecific and phylogenetic analyses yielded congruent results. Seed and fruit size were expected, and confirmed, to be tightly related. As expected, plant height was correlated with each of seed and fruit size, albeit weakly. Weak support was found for an expected positive relationship between leaf and fruit size. The prediction that SLA and WD would be negatively correlated was not supported. Otherwise the traits were predicted to be largely unrelated, being representatives of putatively independent strategy dimensions. This was indeed the case, although WD was consistently, negatively related to leaf size. CONCLUSIONS: The dimensions represented by SLA, seed/fruit size and leaf size were essentially independent and thus conveyed largely independent information about plant strategies. To a lesser extent the same was true for plant height and WD. Our tentative explanation for negative WD-leaf size relationships, now also known from other habitats, is that the traits are indirectly linked via plant hydraulics.},

Sun leaves were sampled for the eight pioneer species and sun and shade leaves were sampled for the five climax species. Sun leaves had a slightly higher absorptance than shade leaves, although differences were small. Sun leaves had a higher leaf mass per unit area (LMA) and a lower chlorophyll concentration per unit leaf mass, resulting in similar chlorophyll concentrations per unit leaf area and hence similar light harvesting capacities as shade leaves. However, shade leaves realized a higher efficiency of absorptance per unit leaf biomass than sun leaves. There were few differences in leaf characteristics of sun leaves between the climax and pioneer species. Absorptance values of cloud forest species were comparable with values reported for rain forest and more seasonal forest species. Intraspecific variation in leaf absorptance was largely the result of variation in LMA, whereas interspecific variation in leaf absorptance was largely a result of variation in chlorophyll concentration per unit leaf area.},

abstract = {We investigated leaf physiological traits of dominant canopy trees in four lowland Panamanian forests with contrasting mean annual precipitation (1,800, 2,300, 3,100 and 3,500 mm). There was near complete turn-over of dominant canopy tree species among sites, resulting in greater dominance of evergreen species with long-lived leaves as precipitation increased. Mean structural and physiological traits changed along this gradient as predicted by cost-benefit theories of leaf life span. Nitrogen content per unit mass (Nmass) and light- and CO2-saturated photosynthetic rates per unit mass (Pmass) of upper canopy leaves decreased with annual precipitation, and these changes were partially explained by increasing leaf thickness and decreasing specific leaf area (SLA). Comparison of 1,800 mm and 3,100 mm sites, where canopy access was available through the use of construction cranes, revealed an association among extended leaf longevity, greater structural defense, higher midday leaf water potential, and lower Pmass, Nmass, and SLA at wetter sites. Shorter leaf life spans and more enriched foliar delta15N values in drier sites suggest greater resorption and re-metabolism of leaf N in drier forest. Greater dominance of short-lived leaves with relatively high Pmass in drier sites reflects a strategy to maximize photosynthesis when water is available and to minimize water loss and respiration costs during rainless periods. Overall, our study links coordinated change in leaf functional traits that affect productivity and nutrient cycling to seasonality in lowland tropical forests.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Patterns of species co-existence and species diversity in plant communities remain an important research area despite over a century of intensive scrutiny. To provide mechanistic insight into the rules governing plant species co-existence and diversity, plant community ecologists are increasingly quantifying functional trait values for the species found in a wide range of communities. 2. Despite the promise of a quantitative functional trait approach to plant community ecology, we suggest that, along with examining trait variation across species, an assessment of trait variation within species should also be a key component of a trait-based approach to community ecology. Variability within and between individuals and populations is likely widespread due to plastic responses to highly localized abiotic and biotic interactions. 3. In this study, we quantify leaf trait variation within and across ten co-existing tree species in a dry tropical forest in Costa Rica to ask: (i) whether the majority of trait variation is located between species, within species, within individuals or within the leaves themselves; (ii) whether trait values collected using standardized methods correlate with those collected using unstandardized methods; and (iii) to what extent can we differentiate plant species on the basis of their traits? 4. We find that the majority of variation in traits was often explained by between species differences; however, between leaflet trait variation was very high for compound-leaved species. We also show that many species are difficult to reliably differentiate on the basis of functional traits even when sampling many individuals. 5. We suggest an ideal sample size of at least 10, and ideally 20, individuals be used when calculating mean trait values for individual species for entire communities, though even at large sample sizes, it remains unclear if community level trait values will allow comparisons on a larger geographic scale or if species traits are generally similar across scales. It will thus be critical to account for intraspecific variation by comparing species mean trait values across space in multiple microclimatic environments within local communities and along environmental gradients. Further, quantifying trait variability due to plasticity and inheritance will provide a better understanding of the underlying patterns and drivers of trait variation as well as the application of functional traits in outlining mechanisms of species co-existence.},

abstract = {Cohesion-tension transport of water is an energetically efficient way to carry large amounts of water from the roots up to the leaves. However, the cohesion-tension mechanism places the xylem water under negative hydrostatic pressure (Px), rendering it susceptible to cavitation. There are conflicts among the structural requirements for minimizing cavitation on the one hand vs maximizing efficiency of transport and construction on the other. Cavitation by freeze-thaw events is triggered by in situ air bubble formation and is much more likely to occur as conduit diameter increases, creating a direct conflict between conducting efficiency and sensitivity to freezing induced xylem failure. Temperate ring-porous trees and vines with wide diameter conduits tend to have a shorter growing season than conifers and diffuse-porous trees with narrow conduits. Cavitation by water stress occurs by air seeding at interconduit pit membranes. Pit membrane structure is at least partially uncoupled from conduit size, leading to a much less pronounced trade-off between conducting efficiency and cavitation by drought than by freezing. Although wider conduits are generally more susceptible to drought-induced cavitation within an organ, across organs or species this trend is very weak. Different trade-offs become apparent at the level of the pit membranes that interconnect neighbouring conduits. Increasing porosity of pit membranes should enhance conductance but also make conduits more susceptible to air seeding. Increasing the size or number of pit membranes would also enhance conductance, but may weaken the strength of the conduit wall against implosion. The need to avoid conduit collapse under negative pressure creates a significant trade-off between cavitation resistance and xylem construction cost, as revealed by relationships between conduit wall strength, wood density and cavitation pressure. Trade-offs involving cavitation resistance may explain the correlations between wood anatomy, cavitation resistance, and the physiological range of negative pressure experienced by species in their native habitats.},

Here we propose that plant functional traits, as determinants of species performance, may be useful tools for quantifying species niche parameters over environmental gradients. Important findingsUnder this framework, the mean trait values of a species determine its niche position along gradients, and intraspecific trait variability determines its niche breadth. This trait-based approach can provide an operational assessment of niche for a potentially large number of species, making it possible to understand and predict species niche shifts under environmental changes. We further advocate a promising method that recently appeared in the literature, which partitions trait diversity into among- and within-community components as a way to quantify the species niche in units of traits instead of environmental parameters. This approach allows the switch of the focus from ecological niches to trait niches, facilitating the examination of species coexistence along undefined environmental gradients. Altogether, the trait-based approach provides a promising toolkit for quantifying the species ecological niche and for understanding the evolution of species niche and traits.},

abstract = {The causes underlying bark diversity are unclear. Variation has been frequently attributed to environmental differences across sites. However, variation may also result from tradeoffs and coordination between bark's multiple functions. Bark traits may also covary with wood and leaf traits as part of major dimensions of plant variation. To assess hypotheses regarding tradeoffs and functional coordination, we measured bark traits reflecting protection, storage, mechanics, and photosynthesis in branches of 90 species spanning a wide phylogenetic and environmental range. We also tested associations between bark, wood, and leaf traits. We partitioned trait variation within species, and within and across communities to quantify variation associated with across-site differences. We observed associations between bark mechanics and storage, density and thickness, and thickness and photosynthetic activity. Increasing bark thickness contributed significantly to stiffer stems and greater water storage. Bark density, water content, and mechanics covaried strongly with the equivalent wood traits, and to a lesser degree with leaf size, xylem conductivity, and vessel diameter. Most variation was observed within sites and had low phylogenetic signal. Compared with relatively minor across-site differences, tradeoffs and coordination among functions of bark, leaves, and wood are likely to be major and overlooked factors shaping bark ecology and evolution.},

abstract = {Abstract. Community assembly processes are thought to shape the mean, spread, and spacing of functional trait values within communities. Two broad categories of assembly processes have been proposed: first, a habitat filter that restricts the range of viable strategies and second, a partitioning of microsites and/or resources that leads to a limit to the similarity of coexisting species. The strength of both processes may be dependent on conditions at a particular site and may change along an abiotic gradient. We sampled environmental variables and plant communities in 44 plots across the varied topography of a coastal California landscape. We characterized 14 leaf, stem, and root traits for 54 woody plant species, including detailed intraspecific data for two traits with the goal of understanding the connection between traits and assembly processes in a variety of environmental conditions. We examined the within-community mean, range, variance, kurtosis, and other measures of spacing of trait values. In this landscape, there was a topographically mediated gradient in water availability. Across this gradient we observed strong shifts in both the plot-level mean trait values and the variation in trait values within communities. Trends in trait means with the environment were due largely to species turnover, with intraspecific shifts playing a smaller role. Traits associated with a vertical partitioning of light showed a greater range and variance on the wet soils, while nitrogen per area, which is associated with water use efficiency, showed a greater spread on the dry soils. We found strong nonrandom patterns in the trait distributions consistent with expectations based on trait-mediated community assembly. There was a significant reduction in the range of six out of 11 leaf and stem functional trait values relative to a null model. For specific leaf area (SLA) we found a significant even spacing of trait values relative to the null model. For seed size we found a more platykurtic distribution than expected. These results suggest that both a habitat filter and a limit to the similarity of coexisting species can simultaneously shape the distribution of traits and the assembly of local plant communities.},

abstract = {Functional diversity (FD) is a key facet of biodiversity used to address$\backslash$ncentral questions in ecology. Despite recent methodological advances, FD$\backslash$nremains a complex concept and no consensus has been reached either on$\backslash$nhow to quantify it, or on how it influences ecological processes. Here$\backslash$nwe define FD as the distribution of trait values within a community.$\backslash$nWhen and how to account for intraspecific trait variability (ITV) when$\backslash$nmeasuring FD remains one of the main current debates. It remains however$\backslash$nunclear to what extent accounting for population-level ITV would modify$\backslash$nFD quantification and associated conclusions. In this paper, we address$\backslash$ntwo critical questions: (1) How sensitive are different components of FD$\backslash$nto the inclusion of population-level ITV? (2) Does the omission of ITV$\backslash$nobscure the understanding of ecological patterns? Using a mixture of$\backslash$nempirical data and simulation experiments, we conducted a sensitivity$\backslash$nanalysis of four commonly used FD indices (community weighted mean$\backslash$ntraits, functional richness, Rao's quadratic entropy, Petchey and$\backslash$nGaston's FD index) and their relationships with environmental gradients$\backslash$nand species richness, by varying both the extent (plasticity or not) and$\backslash$nthe structure (contingency to environmental gradient due to local$\backslash$nadaptation) of population-level ITV. Our results suggest that ITV may$\backslash$nstrongly alter the quantification of FD and the detection of ecological$\backslash$npatterns. Our analysis highlights that 1) species trait values$\backslash$ndistributions within communities are crucial to the sensitivity to ITV,$\backslash$n2) ITV structure plays a major role in this sensitivity and 3) different$\backslash$nindices are not evenly sensitive to ITV, the single-trait FD from$\backslash$nPetchey and Gaston being the most sensitive among the four metrics$\backslash$ntested. We conclude that the effects of intraspecific variability in$\backslash$ntrait values should be more systematically tested before drawing central$\backslash$nconclusions on FD, and suggest the use of simulation studies for such$\backslash$nsensitivity analyses.},

abstract = {Plant functional traits can vary widely as a result of phenotypic plasticity to abiotic conditions. Trait variation may also reflect responses to the identity of neighbours, although not all species are equally responsive to their biotic surroundings. We hypothesized that responses to neighbours are shaped by spatial community patterns and resulting variability in neighbour composition. More precisely, we tested the theoretical prediction that plasticity is most likely to evolve if alternative environments (in this case, different neighbour species) are common and encountered at similar frequencies. We estimated the frequencies of encountering different neighbour species in the field for 27 grassland species and measured the aboveground morphological responses of each species to conspecific vs heterospecific neighbours in a common garden. Responses to neighbour identity were dependent on how frequently the experimental neighbours were encountered by the focal species in their home community, with the greatest plasticity observed in species that encountered both neighbours (conspecific and heterospecific) with high and even frequency. Biotic interactions with neighbouring species can impose selection on plasticity in functional traits, which may feed back through trait divergence and niche differentiation to influence species coexistence and community structure.},

However, extant methods to sample from hypervolumes or measure their geometry perform poorly on high-dimensional or holey datasets. Innovation We first highlight the conceptual and computational issues that have prevented a more direct approach to measuring hypervolumes. Next, we present a new multivariate kernel density estimation method that resolves many of these problems in an arbitrary number of dimensions. Main conclusions We show that our method (implemented as the ‘hypervolume' R package) can match several extant methods for hypervolume geometry and species distribution modelling. Tools to quantify high-dimensional ecological hypervolumes will enable a wide range of fundamental descriptive, inferential and comparative questions to be addressed.},

abstract = {Our understanding of leaf acclimation in relation to irradiance of fully grown or juvenile trees is mainly based on research involving tropical wet forest species. We studied sun-shade plasticity of 24 leaf traits of 43 tree species in a Bolivian dry deciduous forest. Sampling was confined to small trees. For each species, leaves were taken from five of the most and five of the least illuminated crowns. Trees were selected based on the percentage of the hemisphere uncovered by other crowns. We examined leaf trait variation and the relation between trait plasticity and light demand, maximum adult stature, and ontogenetic changes in crown exposure of the species. Leaf trait variation was mainly related to differences among species and to a minor extent to differences in light availability. Traits related to the palisade layer, thickness of the outer cell wall, and N(area) and P(area) had the greatest plasticity, suggesting their importance for leaf function in different light environments. Short-lived pioneers had the highest trait plasticity. Overall plasticity was modest and rarely associated with juvenile light requirements, adult stature, or ontogenetic changes in crown exposure. Dry forest tree species had a lower light-related plasticity than wet forest species, probably because wet forests cast deeper shade. In dry forests light availability may be less limiting, and low water availability may constrain leaf trait plasticity in response to irradiance.},

Six distance-dependent com- petition measures that incorporate tree sizes and distances from neighbors, evaluated over varying competition zones, were used to assess the competition stress among trees. A reduction in the mean square error relative to the no-competition index involved was used to judge the performance of each competition index for 3 growth components (i.e., diameter at breast height (DBH), basal area, and volume). The results showed that except for Martin-Ek, the other competition indices investi- gated were significantly correlated with periodic growth in the 3 growth components (p {\textless} 0.0001). The performance of the competition indices in predicting 5-yr growth indicated that the inclusion of competition indices in the growth-prediction model reduced the mean square error from 14{\%} for volume growth to 17{\%} for DBH growth. Moreover, expanding the search zones in the Hegyi competition index was found to have slightly improved the ability to estimate competition effects.

In this paper, the relative impor- tance of both of these changes in maximizing carbon gain is quantified. Photosynthesis, SLA and nitrogen partitioning within leaves was determined from 10 dicotyledonous C 3 species grown in photon irradiances of 200 and 1000 m mol m - 2 s - 1 . Photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area measured under the growth irradiance was, on average, three times higher for high-light-grown plants than for those grown under low light, and two times higher when measured near light saturation. However, light-saturated photosynthetic rate per unit leaf dry mass was unaltered by growth irradi- ance because low-light plants had double the SLA. Nitro- gen concentrations per unit leaf mass were constant between the two light treatments, but plants grown in low light partitioned a larger fraction of leaf nitrogen into light harvesting. Leaf absorptance was curvilinearly related to chlorophyll content and independent of SLA. Daily photo- synthesis per unit leaf dry mass under low-light conditions was much more responsive to changes in SLA than to nitro- gen partitioning. Under high light, sensitivity to nitrogen partitioning increased, but changes in SLA were still more important.},

To address this deficiency, we partitioned the variance in two key functional traits (leaf mass area and leaf dry matter content) across six nested ecological scales (site, plot, species, tree, strata and leaf) in lowland tropical rainforests. In both traits, the plot level shows virtually no variance despite high species turnover among plots and the size of within-species variation (leaf + strata + tree) is comparable with that of species level variation. The lack of variance at the plot level brings substantial support to the idea that trait-based environmental filtering plays a central role in plant community assembly. These results and the finding that the amount of within-species variation is comparable with interspecific variation support a shift of focus from species-based to trait-based ecology.},

abstract = {• Premise of the Study: Leaf area is a key trait that links plant form, function, and environment. Measures of leaf area can be biased because leaf area is often estimated from dried or fossilized specimens that have shrunk by an unknown amount. We tested the common assumption that this shrinkage is negligible.
• Methods: We measured shrinkage by comparing dry and fresh leaf area in 3401 leaves of 380 temperate and tropical species and used phylogenetic and trait-based approaches to determine predictors of this shrinkage. We also tested the effects of rehydration and simulated fossilization on shrinkage in four species.
• Key Results: We found that dried leaves shrink in area by an average of 22{\%} and a maximum of 82{\%}. Shrinkage in dried leaves can be predicted by multiple morphological traits with a standard deviation of 7.8{\%}. We also found that mud burial, a proxy for compression fossilization, caused negligible shrinkage, and that rehydration, a potential treatment of dried herbarium specimens, eliminated shrinkage.
• Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the amount of shrinkage is driven by variation in leaf area, leaf thickness, evergreenness, and woodiness and can be reversed by rehydration. The amount of shrinkage may also be a useful trait related to ecologically and physiological differences in drought tolerance and plant life history.},

Recently, there has been a new emphasis on intraspecific variability. Indeed, recent developments in trait-based community ecology have underlined the need to integrate variation at both the intraspecific as well as interspecific level. We introduce new T-statistics ('T' for trait), based on the comparison of intraspecific and interspecific variances of functional traits across organizational levels, to operationally incorporate intraspecific variability into community ecology theory. We show that a focus on the distribution of traits at local and regional scales combined with original analytical tools can provide unique insights into the primary forces structuring communities. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Intraspecific trait variability (ITV) plays a central part in various ecological pro-cesses, though using mean trait values may be sufficient in some instances. Ecol-ogists need thus to find under which circumstances. Carlucci et al. (2015, this issue) bring new evidence on the importance of ITV for community assembly across a strong gradient. Sampling design may affect ITV quantification across gradients. Over the last years, growing evidence has accumulated on the fundamental role intraspecific trait variability (ITV) plays on ecological and evolutionary processes. Moving beyond the use of mean trait values may improve our understanding of processes acting within and among com-munities (Violle et al. 2012). However, given that (1) eco-logical field work cannot be exhaustive, (2) ITV generally contributes less to trait variance than interspecific differ-ences, and (3) ITV is rarely documented in trait databases, it has become critical to identify those circumstances under which ITV should not be neglected (Albert et al. 2011). Dealing with understory sapling communities across a canopy openness gradient in Brasil, Carlucci et al. (2015) bring new evidence to this debate. We may deplore that only specific leaf area (SLA) was measured, traits being known to be unevenly variable (Albert et al. 2010; Kichenin et al. 2013). However, they nicely explore the partition of variance both irrespective of community com-position and across the gradient, compare the response of the trait mean (CWM) and variance (FD), and compare the effect of ITV within (ITV within) and among (ITV among) communities. In this study, accounting for ITV enhances both mean plant responses and niche partitioning along the gradient. While ITV contributes less to trait variance than interspecific differences, it still disproportionately counts for revealing community patterns that otherwise could be misinterpreted (Jung et al. 2010). This reinforces the view that representing less than half of trait variation is not meaningful enough to serve as the criterion for decid-ing when ignoring ITV is reasonable (Albert et al. 2011). Four of their results are of specific interest. First, Carlucci et al. (2015) found ITV among to be much more important than ITV within for the variation in FD across the gradient. In previous studies a large part of ITV occurred within communities (Albert et al. 2010; Messier et al. 2010). We may thus wonder whether this reduced},

We extend these tissue-specific analyses of functional strategy towards a whole-plant approach by integrating data on functional traits for 13 448 leaves and wood tissues from 4672 trees representing 668 species of Neotropical trees. Strong correlations amongst traits previously defined as the leaf economics spectrum reflect a tradeoff between investments in productive leaves with rapid turnover vs. costly physical leaf structure with a long revenue stream. A second axis of variation, the ‘stem economics spectrum', defines a similar tradeoff at the stem level: dense wood vs. high wood water content and thick bark. Most importantly, these two axes are orthogonal, suggesting that tradeoffs operate independently at the leaf and at the stem levels. By simplifying the multivariate ecological strategies of tropical trees into positions along these two spectra, our results provide a basis to improve global vegetation models predicting responses of tropical forests to global change.},

abstract = {Trait-based studies have become extremely common in plant ecology. Trait-based approaches often rely on the tacit assumption that intraspecific trait variability (ITV) is negligible compared to interspecific variability, so that species can be characterized by mean trait values. Yet, numerous recent studies have challenged this assumption by showing that ITV significantly affects various ecological processes. Accounting for ITV may thus strengthen trait-based approaches, but measuring trait values on a large number of individuals per species and site is not feasible. Therefore, it is important and timely to synthesize existing knowledge on ITV in order to (1) decide critically when ITV should be considered, and (2) establish methods for incorporating this variability. Here we propose a practical set of rules to identify circumstances under which ITV should be accounted for. We formulate a spatial trait variance partitioning hypothesis to highlight the spatial scales at which ITV cannot be ignored in ecological studies. We then refine a set of four consecutive questions on the research question, the spatial scale, the sampling design, and the type of studied traits, to determine case-by-case if a given study should quantify ITV and test its effects. We review methods for quantifying ITV and develop a step-by-step guideline to design and interpret simulation studies that test for the importance of ITV. Even in the absence of quantitative knowledge on ITV, its effects can be assessed by varying trait values within species within realistic bounds around the known mean values. We finish with a discussion of future requirements to further incorporate ITV within trait-based approaches. This paper thus delineates a general framework to account for ITV and suggests a direction towards a more quantitative trait-based ecology. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {*
The leaf economics spectrum (LES) provides a useful framework for examining species strategies as shaped by their evolutionary history. However, that spectrum, as originally described, involved only two key resources (carbon and nutrients) and one of three economically important plant organs. Herein, I evaluate whether the economics spectrum idea can be broadly extended to water – the third key resource –stems, roots and entire plants and to individual, community and ecosystem scales. My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade-off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources.



*
Evidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients. These apply generally within and across scales (within and across communities, climate zones, biomes and lineages).



*
There are linkages across organs and coupling among resources, resulting in an integrated whole-plant economics spectrum. Species capable of moving water rapidly have low tissue density, short tissue life span and high rates of resource acquisition and flux at organ and individual scales. The reverse is true for species with the slow strategy. Different traits may be important in different conditions, but as being fast in one respect generally requires being fast in others, being fast or slow is a general feature of species.



*
Economic traits influence performance and fitness consistent with trait-based theory about underlying adaptive mechanisms. Traits help explain differences in growth and survival across resource gradients and thus help explain the distribution of species and the assembly of communities across light, water and nutrient gradients. Traits scale up – fast traits are associated with faster rates of ecosystem processes such as decomposition or primary productivity, and slow traits with slow process rates.



*
Synthesis. Traits matter. A single ‘fast–slow' plant economics spectrum that integrates across leaves, stems and roots is a key feature of the plant universe and helps to explain individual ecological strategies, community assembly processes and the functioning of ecosystems.},

However, a general picture of the relative extent of ITV compared to interspecific trait variation in plant communities is still missing. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relative extent of ITV within and among plant communities worldwide, using a data set encompassing 629 communities (plots) and 36 functional traits. Overall, ITV accounted for 25{\%} of the total trait variation within communities and 32{\%} of the total trait variation among communities on average. The relative extent of ITV tended to be greater for whole-plant (e.g. plant height) vs. organ-level traits and for leaf chemical (e.g. leaf N and P concentration) vs. leaf morphological (e.g. leaf area and thickness) traits. The relative amount of ITV decreased with increasing species richness and spatial extent, but did not vary with plant growth form or climate. These results highlight global patterns in the relative importance of ITV in plant communities, providing practical guidelines for when researchers should include ITV in trait-based community and ecosystem studies.},

abstract = {• Premise of the Study: Leaf area is a key trait that links plant form, function, and environment. Measures of leaf area can be biased because leaf area is often estimated from dried or fossilized specimens that have shrunk by an unknown amount. We tested the common assumption that this shrinkage is negligible.
• Methods: We measured shrinkage by comparing dry and fresh leaf area in 3401 leaves of 380 temperate and tropical species and used phylogenetic and trait-based approaches to determine predictors of this shrinkage. We also tested the effects of rehydration and simulated fossilization on shrinkage in four species.
• Key Results: We found that dried leaves shrink in area by an average of 22{\%} and a maximum of 82{\%}. Shrinkage in dried leaves can be predicted by multiple morphological traits with a standard deviation of 7.8{\%}. We also found that mud burial, a proxy for compression fossilization, caused negligible shrinkage, and that rehydration, a potential treatment of dried herbarium specimens, eliminated shrinkage.
• Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the amount of shrinkage is driven by variation in leaf area, leaf thickness, evergreenness, and woodiness and can be reversed by rehydration. The amount of shrinkage may also be a useful trait related to ecologically and physiological differences in drought tolerance and plant life history.},

To address this deficiency, we partitioned the variance in two key functional traits (leaf mass area and leaf dry matter content) across six nested ecological scales (site, plot, species, tree, strata and leaf) in lowland tropical rainforests. In both traits, the plot level shows virtually no variance despite high species turnover among plots and the size of within-species variation (leaf + strata + tree) is comparable with that of species level variation. The lack of variance at the plot level brings substantial support to the idea that trait-based environmental filtering plays a central role in plant community assembly. These results and the finding that the amount of within-species variation is comparable with interspecific variation support a shift of focus from species-based to trait-based ecology.},

Three- quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global spectrum of plant form and function. One major dimension within this plane reflects the size of whole plants and their parts; the other represents the leaf economics spectrum, which balances leaf construction costs against growth potential.

Using data from forests in the southeastern United States, I show here that variation evident at the individual level provides for coexistence of large numbers of competitors. Variation among individuals within populations allows species to differ in their distributions of responses to the environment, despite the fact that the populations to which they belong do not differ, on average. Results are consistent with theory predicting that coexistence depends on competition being stronger within than between species, shown here by analysis of individual-level responses to environmental fluctuation.},

@article{violle_let_2007,
abstract = {In its simplest definition, a trait is a surrogate of organismal performance, and this meaning of the term has been used by evolutionists for a long time. Over the last three decades, developments in community and ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term “trait” itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the “performance paradigm” to plant ecology. “Functional traits” are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing “integration functions” which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.},

@article{freschet_evidence_2010,
abstract = {1. A fundamental trade-off among vascular plants between traits inferring rapid resource acquisition and those leading to conservation of resources has now been accepted broadly, but is based on empirical data with a strong bias towards leaf traits. Here, we test whether interspecific variation in traits of different plant organs obeys this same trade-off and whether within-plant trade-offs are consistent between organs. 2. Thereto, we measured suites of the same chemical and structural traits from the main vegetative organs for a species set representing aquatic, riparian and terrestrial environments including the main vascular higher taxa and growth forms of a subarctic flora. The traits were chosen to have consistent relevance for plant defence and growth across organs and environments: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, lignin, dry matter content, pH. 3. Our analysis shows several new trait correlations across leaves, stems and roots and a striking pattern of whole-plant integrative resource economy, leading to tight correspondence between the local leaf economics spectrum and the root (r = 0.64), stem (r = 0.78) and whole-plant (r = 0.93) economics spectra. 4. Synthesis. Our findings strongly suggest that plant resource economics is consistent across species' organs in a subarctic flora. We provide thus the first evidence for a ‘plant economics spectrum' closely related to the local subarctic ‘leaf economics spectrum'. Extending that concept to other biomes is, however, necessary before any generalization might be made. In a world facing rapid vegetation change, these results nevertheless bear considerable prospects of predicting below-ground plant functions from the above-ground components alone.},

@article{fortunel_leaf_2012,
abstract = {1. Trade-offs among functional traits reveal major plant strategies that can give insight into species distributions and ecosystem processes. However, current identification of plant strategies lacks the integration of root structural traits together with leaf and stem traits. 2. We examined correlations among 14 traits representing leaf, stem and woody root tissues. Traits were measured on 1084 individuals representing 758 Neotropical tree species, across 13 sites representative of the environmental variation encompassed by three widespread habitats (seasonally flooded, clay terra firme and white-sand forests) at opposite ends of Amazonia (French Guiana and Peru). 3. Woody root traits were closely aligned with stem traits, but not with leaf traits. Altogether leaf, stem and woody root traits delineated two orthogonal axes of functional trade-offs: a first axis defined by leaf traits, corresponding to a ‘leaf economics spectrum', and a second axis defined by covarying stem and woody root traits, corresponding to a ‘wood economics spectrum'. These axes remained consistent when accounting for species evolutionary history with phylogenetically independent contrasts. 4. Despite the strong species turnover across sites, the covariation among root and stem structural traits as well as their orthogonality to leaf traits were strongly consistent across habitats and regions. 5. We conclude that root structural traits mirrored stem traits rather than leaf traits in Neotropical trees. Leaf and wood traits define an integrated whole-plant strategy in lowland South American forests that may contribute to a more complete understanding of plant responses to global changes in both correlative and modelling approaches. We suggest further meta-analyses in expanded environmental and geographic zones to determine the generality of this pattern.},

abstract = {Assessing trait responses to environmental gradients requires the simultaneous analysis of the information contained in three tables: L (species distribution across samples), R (environmental characteristics of samples), and Q (species traits). Among the available methods, the so-called fourth-corner and RLQ methods are two appealing alternatives that provide a direct way to test and estimate trait–environment relationships. Both methods are based on the analysis of the fourth-corner matrix, which crosses traits and environmental variables weighted by species abundances. However, they differ greatly in their outputs: RLQ is a multivariate technique that provides ordination scores to summarize the joint structure among the three tables, whereas the fourth-corner method mainly tests for individual trait–environment relationships (i.e., one trait and one environmental variable at a time). Here, we illustrate how the complementarity between these two methods can be exploited to promote new ecological knowledge and to improve the study of trait–environment relationships. After a short description of each method, we apply them to real ecological data to present their different outputs and provide hints about the gain resulting from their combined use.},

abstract = {Aim: More than ever, ecologists seek to understand how species are distributed and have assembled into communities using the “filtering framework”. This framework is based on the hypothesis that local assemblages result from a series of abiotic and biotic filters applied to regional species pools and that these filters leave predictable signals in observed diversity patterns. In theory, statistical comparisons of expected and observed patterns enable data-driven tests of assembly processes. However, so far this framework has fallen short in delivering generalizable conclusions, challenging whether (and how) diversity patterns can be used to characterize and understand underlying assembly processes better. Methods: By synthesizing the previously raised critiques and suggested solutions in a comprehensive way, we identify 10 pitfalls that can lead to flawed interpretations of $\alpha$-diversity patterns, summarize solutions developed to circumvent these pitfalls and provide general guidelines. Results: We find that most issues arise from an overly simplistic view of potential processes that influence diversity patterns, which is often motivated by practical constraints on study design, focal scale and methodology. We outline solutions for each pitfall, such as methods spanning over spatial, environmental or phylogenetic scales, and suggest guidelines for best scientific practices in community ecology. Among key future challenges are the integration of mechanistic modelling and multi-trophic interactions. Main conclusions: Our conclusion is that the filtering framework still holds promise, but only if researchers successfully navigate major pitfalls, foster the integration of mechanistic modelling and multi-trophic interactions and directly account for uncertainty in their conclusions.},

The effect of diversity on plant biomass was associated primarily with the accumulation of higher total plant nitrogen pools (N g m(-2)) and secondarily with more efficient N use at higher diversity. The accumulation of N in living plant biomass was significantly increased by the presence of legumes, C4 grasses, and their combined presence. Thus, these results provide clear evidence for the increasing effects of complementarity through time and suggest a mechanism whereby diversity increases complementarity through the increased input and retention of N, a commonly limiting nutrient.},

* Here, using a data set of 626 462 trees sampled throughout 8300 km2 in central Africa and historical information collected 60 years ago on forest successional status, we compare sexual system assemblages between young successional and mature communities.


* We use two multivariate approaches to assess the variation in community dioecism between successional status, while controlling for covariation between dioecy and six other traits usually considered as good proxies for important functions in forest successional dynamics.


* We show that dioecious trees are significantly overrepresented in young successional areas, contrary to classical expectations. This robust pattern is unlikely to be driven by soil conditions, by the other associated traits or by species-specific abundance. Strikingly, dioecy was one of the traits most correlated with young successional areas.


* These results show that sexual systems play an important role in community assembly. The higher occurrence of dioecy in young successional areas is likely due to a higher relative seed fitness of dioecious species in more stressful conditions or by an evolutionary-driven association between dioecy and colonization ability, as predicted by theoretical studies.


* Synthesis. Our study emphasizes an overlooked association between sexual system and community assembly and emphasizes the need to revisit classical assumptions regarding that relationship.},

@article{Hooper2005a,
abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1)Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species', ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental, work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

abstract = {1. Experimental manipulations of plant species diversity in unfertilised prairies and meadows has revealed that increasing diversity often leads to increased productivity (range of observed relationships varies from flat to log-linearly positive); driven by a combination of facilitation, niche-partitioning and sampling/selection effects. 2. The longer-term effects of diversity on ecosystem stability are not as clear and in need of further work. 3. Recent applied work, and a new review of the grassland literature, both show the potential for biodiversity to increase productivity under realistic field conditions. 4. The longer-term feedback of grazers on biodiversity gradients is unknown, and grassland biodiversity experiments that incorporate grazers will be needed to test whether patterns differ from those seen in ungrazed prairies and meadows. 5. The relationship between diversity and productivity seen in local experiments is often different from regional-scale correlations, and the scaling-up of experimental results remains a research priority.},

abstract = {Central American Bignoniaceae show five distinct patterns of flowering phenology. Four of these phenol6gical types characterize different bee-pollinated species. Only the generalized "cornucopia" strategy is employed by temperate Big-noniaceae. In the tropics this strategy is also prevalent and is often associated with a seasonal sequence of flowering by related species. The more specialized phenological strategies employed by many tropical species of Bignoniaceae are viewed as making possible differential and essentially contemporaneous attraction of similar pollinators from the same limited pollinator resource. The high diversity of tropical Bignoniaceae appears to be facilitated by use of a variety of phenological strategies by the different species. It is suggested that such mechanisms may be an important factor in maintaining increased tropical diversity in other groups of plants. DIFFERENCES IN flowering phenology among Cen-tral American Bignoniaceae illustrate an overlooked mechanism for maintenance of high species diversity in tropical plant communities. The ecological im-portance of these differences in phenology is in making possible effective and often contemporane-ous sharing by numerous plant species of a limited pollinator resource. Evolutionary diversification of floral morphology in the Bignoniaceae has, of course, given rise to genera employing most of the potential pollen vectors available in a tropical community (Gentry 1972, 1973). But although bats (in Par-mentiera, Crescentia, Dendrosicus), hummingbirds (in Mawrtinella), hawkmoths (in Tanaecium), and butterflies and small bees (in Tynnanthus and Ar-rabidaea florida) are the principal pollinators of some Bignoniaceae, the majority of the 76 species occurring naturally in Costa Rica and Panama are pollinated by large and medium-sized bees, especial-ly female euglossines. In some bee-pollinated spe-cies additional morphologic specializations further re-strict potential pollen vectors as in Amphilophium where pseudocleistogamous flowers which never open spontaneously can be entered only by the strongest members of the apifauna (Megachile, large anthophorids, presumably xylocopids). However, most bee-pollinated species of Bignoniaceae secure their requisite pollinators by different strategies of flower production rather than morphologic},

We investigated the phenotypic responses of 7 populations of an important dominant species in semi-arid steppe of China - Stipa grandis, and then distinguished which adaptive mechanism(s), phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation, was/were involved in this species to adapt to environmental changes. (1) All traits were significantly influenced by the interaction of population and growth condition and by population in each condition, and inter-population variability (CVinter) was larger in the field than in the common garden for 8/9 traits, indicating that both phenotypic plasticity and genetic differentiation controlled the phenotypic differences of S. grandis. (2) From a functional standpoint, the significant relationships between the values of traits in the common garden and the environmental variables in their original habitats couldn't support local habitat adaptation of these traits. (3) Low CVintra, low quantitative differentiation among populations (Q ST ), and low plasticity shown in the western populations indicated the very low adaptive potential of S. grandis to environmental changes. (4) From the original habitats to the common garden which is far away from S. grandis distribution region, positive phenotypic responses were found in several populations, indicating that some original habitats have become unfavorable for S. grandis.},

abstract = {Niche complementarity, in which coexisting species use different forms of a resource, has been widely invoked to explain some of the most debated patterns in ecology, including maintenance of diversity and relationships between diversity and ecosystem function. However, classical models assume resource specialization in the form of distinct niches, which does not obviously apply to the broadly overlapping resource use in plant communities. Here we utilize an experimental framework based on competition theory to test whether plants partition resources via classical niche differentiation or via plasticity in resource use. We explore two alternatives: niche preemption, in which individuals respond to a superior competitor by switching to an alternative, less-used resource, and dominant plasticity, in which superior competitors exhibit high resource use plasticity and shift resource use depending on the competitive environment. We determined competitive ability by measuring growth responses with and without neighbors over a growing season and then used 15N tracer techniques to measure uptake of different nitrogen (N) forms in a field setting. We show that four alpine plant species of differing competitive abilities have statistically indistinguishable uptake patterns (nitrate {\textgreater} ammonium {\textgreater} glycine) in their fundamental niche (without competitors) but differ in whether they shift these uptake patterns in their realized niche (with competitors). Competitively superior species increased their uptake of the most available N form, ammonium, when in competition with the rarer, competitively inferior species. In contrast, the competitively inferior species did not alter its N uptake pattern in competition. The existence of plasticity in resource use among the dominant species provides a mechanism that helps to explain the manner by which plant species with broadly overlapping resource use might coexist.},

abstract = {Tropical forests are vital ecosystems which provide numerous ecological functions and forest models can be used to simulate their dynamics. However, due to the high species diversity of tropical forests and the common lack of detailed knowledge about these species, simulating the behavior of each species separately is not feasible. Therefore, species with common characteristics are usually aggregated into species groups. Although the number of species groups is likely to be an important characteristic of forest models, little research has been done on its effect on the results of the model. In this article, we compare the effect of the number of species groups using a physiological forest gap model and review our results using 28 years of field data from a 50. ha forest plot in Panama as well as a chronosequence over four centuries from the same area. The number of simulated groups ranged from 1 to 4, 9 and 16. The parameterization with a single species group is a "neutral" parameterization with all simulated trees being ecophysiologically identical. The number of groups turned out to be an important characteristic of the model which influences its results on a fundamental level. Steady-states characteristics of forests like stem-numbers and stem-size distributions can be successfully simulated with even a single species group while modeling the long-term dynamics requires a higher number of groups. On the downside, a higher number of groups makes parameterization and fitting of the model more difficult. We conclude that the number of species groups is a vital characteristic of a forest model which has far-reaching consequences for its results and needs to be chosen with care. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {(Table presented.). Summary: Tropical rainforest (TRF) is the most species-rich terrestrial biome on Earth, harbouring just under half of the world's plant species in c. 7{\%} of the land surface. Phylogenetic trees provide important insights into mechanisms underpinning TRF hyperdiversity that are complementary to those obtained from the fossil record. Phylogenetic studies of TRF plant diversity have mainly focused on whether this biome is an evolutionary ‘cradle' or ‘museum', emphasizing speciation and extinction rates. However, other explanations, such as biome age, immigration and ecological limits, must also be considered. We present a conceptual framework for addressing the drivers of TRF diversity, and review plant studies that have tested them with phylogenetic data. Although surprisingly few in number, these studies point to old age of TRF, low extinction and high speciation rates as credible drivers of TRF hyperdiversity. There is less evidence for immigration and ecological limits, but these cannot be dismissed owing to the limited number of studies. Rapid methodological developments in DNA sequencing, macroevolutionary analysis and the integration of phylogenetics with other disciplines may improve our grasp of TRF hyperdiversity in the future. However, such advances are critically dependent on fundamental systematic research, yielding numerous, additional, well-sampled phylogenies of TRF lineages.},

abstract = {Background: Using phylogenomic analysis tools for tracking pathogens has become standard practice in academia, public health agencies, and large industries. Using the same raw read genomic data as input, there are several different approaches being used to infer phylogenetic tree. These include many different SNP pipelines, wgMLST approaches, k-mer algorithms, whole genome alignment and others; each of these has advantages and disadvantages, some have been extensively validated, some are faster, some have higher resolution. A few of these analysis approaches are well-integrated into the regulatory process of US Federal agencies (e.g. the FDA's SNP pipeline for tracking foodborne pathogens). However, despite extensive validation on benchmark datasets and comparison with other pipelines, we lack methods for fully exploring the effects of multiple parameter values in each pipeline that can potentially have an effect on whether the correct phylogenetic tree is recovered. Results: To resolve this problem, we offer a program, TreeToReads, which can generate raw read data from mutated genomes simulated under a known phylogeny. This simulation pipeline allows direct comparisons of simulated and observed data in a controlled environment. At each step of these simulations, researchers can vary parameters of interest (e.g., input tree topology, amount of sequence divergence, rate of indels, read coverage, distance of reference genome, etc) to assess the effects of various parameter values on correctly calling SNPs and reconstructing an accurate tree. Conclusions: Such critical assessments of the accuracy and robustness of analytical pipelines are essential to progress in both research and applied settings.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Microbes are thought to maintain diversity in plant communities by specializing on particular species, but it is not known whether microbes that specialize within species (i.e., on genotypes) affect diversity or dynamics in plant communities. Here we show that soil microbes can specialize at the within-population level in a wild plant species, and that such specialization could promote species diversity and seed dispersal in plant communities. In a shadehouse experiment in Panama, we found that seedlings of the native tree species, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Virola surinamensis{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} (Myristicaceae), had reduced performance in the soil microbial community of their maternal tree compared with in the soil microbial community of a nonmaternal tree from the same population. Performance differences were unrelated to soil nutrients or to colonization by mycorrhizal fungi, suggesting that highly specialized pathogens were the mechanism reducing seedling performance in maternal soils. We then constructed a simulation model to explore the ecological and evolutionary consequences of genotype-specific pathogens in multispecies plant communities. Model results indicated that genotype-specific pathogens promote plant species coexistence—albeit less strongly than species-specific pathogens—and are most effective at maintaining species richness when genetic diversity is relatively low. Simulations also revealed that genotype-specific pathogens select for increased seed dispersal relative to species-specific pathogens, potentially helping to create seed dispersal landscapes that allow pathogens to more effectively promote diversity. Combined, our results reveal that soil microbes can specialize within wild plant populations, affecting seedling performance near conspecific adults and influencing plant community dynamics on ecological and evolutionary time scales. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our analyses also estimate inter- and intra-specific competition coefficients and ex- plicitly partition the competitive effects of neighbors into the effects of shading versus crowding. We tested the method using data from forests of northern, interior British Columbia dominated by western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) and western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don). For both species, the most parsimonious regression models included terms for the effects of tree size, crowding, and shading and separate competitive effects of four dif- ferent groups of competing species. The models explained 33{\%}–59{\%} of the variation in radial growth of the two spe- cies. For both species, growth declined more steeply as a function of crowding than shading. There was striking asymmetry in the strength of interspecific competition between hemlock and redcedar, with crowding by hemlock hav- ing a strong per capita effect on redcedar, while crowding by redcedar had relatively little effect on the radial growth of hemlock.

abstract = {Forest trees are an unparalleled group of organisms in their combined ecological, economic and societal importance. With widespread distributions, predominantly random mating systems and large population sizes, most tree species harbour extensive genetic variation both within and among populations. At the same time, demographic processes associated with Pleistocene climate oscillations and land-use change have affected contemporary range-wide diversity and may impinge on the potential for future adaptation. Understanding how these adaptive and neutral processes have shaped the genomes of trees species is therefore central to their management and conservation. As for many other taxa, the advent of high-throughput sequencing methods is expected to yield an understanding of the interplay between the genome and environment at a level of detail and depth not possible only a few years ago. An international conference entitled 'Genomics and Forest Tree Genetics' was held in May 2016, in Arcachon (France), and brought together forest geneticists with a wide range of research interests to disseminate recent efforts that leverage contemporary genomic tools to probe the population, quantitative and evolutionary genomics of trees. An important goal of the conference was to discuss how such data can be applied to both genome-enabled breeding and the conservation of forest genetic resources under land use and climate change. Here, we report discoveries presented at the meeting and discuss how the ecological genomic toolkit can be used to address both basic and applied questions in tree biology.},

abstract = {Gene flow is a fundamental evolutionary force in adaptation that is especially impor- tant to understand as humans are rapidly changing both the natural environment and natural levels of gene flow. Theory proposes a multifaceted role for gene flow in adap- tation, but it focuses mainly on the disruptive effect that gene flow has on adaptation when selection is not strong enough to prevent the loss of locally adapted alleles. The role of gene flow in adaptation is now better understood due to the recent develop- ment of both genomic models of adaptive evolution and genomic techniques, which both point to the importance of genetic architecture in the origin and maintenance of adaptation with gene flow. In this review, we discuss three main topics on the geno- mics of adaptation with gene flow. First, we investigate selection on migration and gene flow. Second, we discuss the three potential sources of adaptive variation in rela- tion to the role of gene flow in the origin of adaptation. Third, we explain how local adaptation is maintained despite gene flow: we provide a synthesis of recent genomic models of adaptation, discuss the genomic mechanisms and review empirical studies on the genomics of adaptation with gene flow. Despite predictions on the disruptive effect of gene flow in adaptation, an increasing number of studies show that gene flow can promote adaptation, that local adaptations can be maintained despite high gene flow, and that genetic architecture plays a fundamental role in the origin and mainte- nance of local adaptation with gene flow},

abstract = {Trait variability in space and time allows plants to adjust to changing environmental conditions. However, we know little about how this variability is distributed and coordinated at different organizational levels. For six dominant tree species in northeastern Spain (three Fagaceae and three Pinaceae) we quantified the inter- and intraspecific variability of a set of traits along a water availability gradient. We measured leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf nitrogen (N) concentration, carbon isotope composition in leaves ($\delta$13C), stem wood density, the Huber value (Hv, the ratio of cross-sectional sapwood area to leaf area), sapwood-specific and leaf-specific stem hydraulic conductivity, vulnerability to xylem embolism (P50) and the turgor loss point (Ptlp). Differences between families explained the largest amount of variability for most traits, although intraspecific variability was also relevant. Species occupying wetter sites showed higher N, P50 and Ptlp, and lower LMA, $\delta$13C and Hv. However, when trait relationships with water availability were assessed within species they held only for Hv and Ptlp. Overall, our results indicate that intraspecific adjustments along the water availability gradient relied primarily on changes in resource allocation between sapwood and leaf area and in leaf water relations.},

abstract = {Summary: Genome-scan methods are used for screening genomewide patterns of DNA polymorphism to detect signatures of positive selection. There are two main types of methods: (i) 'outlier' detection methods based on FST that detect loci with high differentiation compared to the rest of the genome and (ii) environmental association methods that test the association between allele frequencies and environmental variables. We present a new FST-based genome-scan method, BayeScEnv, which incorporates environmental information in the form of 'environmental differentiation'. It is based on the F model, but, as opposed to existing approaches, it considers two locus-specific effects: one due to divergent selection and the other due to various other processes different from local adaptation (e.g. range expansions, differences in mutation rates across loci or background selection). The method was developped in C++ and is available at http://github.com/devillemereuil/bayescenv. A simulation study shows that our method has a much lower false positive rate than an existing FST-based method, BayeScan, under a wide range of demographic scenarios. Although it has lower power, it leads to a better compromise between power and false positive rate. We apply our method to a human data set and show that it can be used successfully to study local adaptation. We discuss its scope and compare it to other existing methods.},

abstract = {Selective logging, the targeted harvesting of timber trees in a single cutting cycle, is globally rising in extent and intensity. Short-term impacts of selective logging on tropical forests have been widely investigated, but long-term effects on temporal dynamics of forest structure and composition are largely unknown. Understanding these long-term dynamics will help determine whether tropical forests are resilient to selective logging and inform choices between competing demands of anthropogenic use versus conservation of tropical forests. Forest dynamics can be studied within the framework of succession theory, which predicts that temporal turnover rates should decline with time since disturbance. Here, we investigated the temporal dynamics of a tropical forest in Kibale National Park, Uganda over 45. years following selective logging. We estimated turnover rates in stems, species composition, and functional traits (wood density and diameter at breast height), using observations from four censuses in 1989, 1999, 2006, and 2013, of stems ???10. cm diameter within 17 unlogged and 9 logged 200. ??. 10. m vegetation plots. We used null models to account for interdependencies among turnover rates in stems, species composition, and functional traits. We tested predictions that turnover rates should be higher and decrease with increasing time since the selective logging event in logged forest, but should be less temporally variable in unlogged forest. Overall, we found higher turnover rates in logged forest for all three attributes, but turnover rates did not decline through time in logged forest and was not less temporally variable in unlogged forest. These results indicate that successional models that assume recovery to pre-disturbance conditions are inadequate for predicting the effects of selective logging on the dynamics of the tropical forest in Kibale. Selective logging resulted in persistently higher turnover rates, which may compromise the carbon storage capacity of Kibale's forest. Selective logging effects may also interact with effects from other global trends, potentially causing major long-term shifts in the dynamics of tropical forests. Similar studies in tropical forests elsewhere will help determine the generality of these conclusions. Ultimately, the view that selective logging is a benign approach to the management of tropical forests should be reconsidered in the light of studies of the effects of this practice on long-term forest dynamics.},

abstract = {Functional ecology aims at determining the relationships between species traits and environmental variables in order to better understand biological processes in ecosystems. From a methodological point of view, this biological objective calls for a method linking three data matrix tables: a table L with abundance or presence–absence values for species at a series of sites, a table R with variables describing the environmental conditions of the sites, and a table Q containing traits (e.g., morphological or behavioral attributes) of the species. Ten years ago, the fourth-corner method was proposed to measure and test the relationships between species traits and environmental variables using tables R, L, and Q simultaneously. In practice, this method is rarely used. The major reasons for this lack of interest are the restriction of the original method and program to presence–absence data in L and to the analysis of a single trait and a single environmental variable at a time. Moreover, ecologists often have problems in choosing a permutation model among the four originally proposed. In this paper, we revisit the fourth-corner method and propose improvements to the original approach. First, we present an extension to measure the link between species traits and environmental variables when the ecological community is described by abundance data. A new multivariate fourth-corner statistic is also proposed. Then, using numerical simulations, we discuss and evaluate the existing testing procedures. A new two-step testing procedure is presented. We hope that these elements will help ecologists use the best possible methodology to analyze this type of ecological problem.},

abstract = {Species delimitation remains a crucial issue for widespread plants occurring across forest-savanna ecotone such as Lophira (Ochnaceae). Most taxonomists recognize two parapatric African tree species, widely distributed and morphologically similar but occurring in contrasted habitats: L. lanceolata in the Sudanian dry forests and savannahs and L. alata in the dense Guineo-Congolian forests. Both species co-occur along a ca. 3000 km long forest-savanna mosaic belt, constituting ideal models for investigating hybridization patterns and the impact of past glacial periods on the genetic structures in two types of ecosystems. We genotyped 10 nuclear microsatellites for 803 individuals sampled across the distribution range of Lophira. Both species exhibit similar levels of genetic diversity [He = 0.52 (L. alata); 0.44 (L. lanceolata)] and are well differentiated, consistent with taxonomic delimitation (FST = 0.36; RST = 0.49), refuting the hypothesis that they might constitute ecotypes rather than distinct species. Furthermore, L. alata displayed two deeply differentiated clusters (FST = 0.37; RST = 0.53) distributed in parapatry, one endemic to Western Gabon while another cluster extended over the remaining species range, suggests that L. alata is made of two cryptic species. We showed that rare hybrids occur in some contact zones between these three species, leaving a weak signal of introgression between L. lanceolata and the northern cluster of L. alata. At the intra-specific level, the latter species also show weak genetic structuring between Upper and Lower Guinea and the intensity did not differ strikingly between rainforest and savanna ecosystems. The discovery of a new species of Lophira with a narrow distribution in West Gabon where it is intensively exploited for its timber requires to evaluate its conservation status.},

Hence an evaluation of inter- and intraspecific variation in drought tolerance is important for selecting the best adapted species and provenances for future afforestation. However, the presence of long vessels makes it difficult to assess xylem vulnerability to embolism in these species. Thanks to the development of a flow centrifuge equipped with a large rotor, we quantified (i) the between species variability of embolism resistance in four native and two exotic species of oaks in Europe and (ii) the within species variability in Quercus petraea. Embolism resistance varied significantly between species, with the pressure inducing 50{\%} loss of hydraulic conductivity (P50) ranging between −7.0 and −4.2 MPa. Species native to the Mediterranean region were more resistant than pan-European species. In contrast, intraspecific variability in embolism resistance in Q. petraea was low within provenances and null between provenances. A positive correlation between P50 and vessel diameter among the six oak species indicates that the more embolism resistant species had narrower xylem vessels and a higher amount of hydraulic bridges between vessels. However, this tradeoff between hydraulic efficiency and safety was not observed between Q. petraea provenances.},

abstract = {Due to its special geological history, the New Caledonian Archipelago is a mosaic of soil types, and in combination with climatic conditions this results in a heterogeneous environment across relatively small distances. A group of over 20 endemic species of Diospyros (Ebenaceae) has rapidly and recently radiated on the archipelago after a single long-distance dispersal event. Most of the Diospyros species in the radiating group are morphologically and ecologically well differentiated, but they exhibit low levels of DNA variability. To investigate the processes that shaped the diversification of this group we employed restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq). Over 8400 filtered SNPs generally confirm species delimitations and produce a well-supported phylogenetic tree. Our analyses document local introgression, but only a limited potential for gene flow over longer distances. The phylogenetic relationships point to an early regional clustering among populations and species, indicating that allopatric speciation with respect to macrohabitat (i.e., climatic conditions) may have had a role in the initial differentiation within the group. A later, more rapid radiation involved divergence with respect to microhabitat (i.e., soil preference). Several sister species in the group show a parallel divergence in edaphic preference. Searches for genomic regions that are systematically differentiated in this replicated phenotypic divergence pointed to loci potentially involved in ion binding and cellular transport. These loci appear meaningful in the context of adaptations to soil types that differ in heavy-metal and mineral content. Identical nucleotide changes affected only two of these loci, indicating that introgression may have played a limited role in their evolution. Our results suggest that both allopatric diversification and (parapatric) ecological divergence shaped successive rounds of speciation in the Diospyros radiation on New Caledonia.},

abstract = {The importance of niche vs. neutral assembly mechanisms in structuring tropical tree communities remains an important unsettled question in community ecology [Bell G (2005) Ecology 86:1757-1770]. There is ample evidence that species distributions are determined by soils and habitat factors at landscape ({\textless}10(4) km(2)) and regional scales. At local scales ({\textless}1 km(2)), however, habitat factors and species distributions show comparable spatial aggregation, making it difficult to disentangle the importance of niche and dispersal processes. In this article, we test soil resource-based niche assembly at a local scale, using species and soil nutrient distributions obtained at high spatial resolution in three diverse neotropical forest plots in Colombia (La Planada), Ecuador (Yasuni), and Panama (Barro Colorado Island). Using spatial distribution maps of {\textgreater}0.5 million individual trees of 1,400 species and 10 essential plant nutrients, we used Monte Carlo simulations of species distributions to test plant-soil associations against null expectations based on dispersal assembly. We found that the spatial distributions of 36-51{\%} of tree species at these sites show strong associations to soil nutrient distributions. Neutral dispersal assembly cannot account for these plant-soil associations or the observed niche breadths of these species. These results indicate that belowground resource availability plays an important role in the assembly of tropical tree communities at local scales and provide the basis for future investigations on the mechanisms of resource competition among tropical tree species.},

abstract = {The degradation of forests in developing countries, particularly those within tropical and subtropical latitudes, is perceived to be an important contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. However, the impacts of forest degradation are understudied and poorly understood, largely because international emission reduction programs have focused on deforestation, which is easier to detect and thus more readily monitored. To better understand and seize opportunities for addressing climate change it will be essential to improve knowledge of greenhouse gas emissions from forest degradation. Here we provide a consistent estimation of forest degradation emissions between 2005 and 2010 across 74 developing countries covering 2.2 billion hectares of forests. We estimated annual emissions of 2.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide, of which 53{\%} were derived from timber harvest, 30{\%} from woodfuel harvest and 17{\%} from forest fire. These percentages differed by region: timber harvest was as high as 69{\%} in South and Central America and just 31{\%} in Africa; woodfuel harvest was 35{\%} in Asia, and just 10{\%} in South and Central America; and fire ranged from 33{\%} in Africa to only 5{\%} in Asia. Of the total emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, forest degradation accounted for 25{\%}. In 28 of the 74 countries, emissions from forest degradation exceeded those from deforestation. The results of this study clearly demonstrate the importance of accounting greenhouse gases from forest degradation by human activities. The scale of emissions presented indicates that the exclusion of forest degradation from national and international GHG accounting is distorting. This work helps identify where emissions are likely significant, but policy developments are needed to guide when and how accounting should be undertaken. Furthermore, ongoing research is needed to create and enhance cost-effective accounting approaches.},

abstract = {We dissected the relationship between genetic differentiation (Q ST) for a trait and its underlying genes (G STq, differentiation for a quantitative locus) in an evolutionary context, with the aim of identifying the conditions in which these two measurements are decoupled. We used two parameters ($\theta$ B and $\theta$ w) scaling the contributions of inter- and intrapopulation allelic covariation between genes controlling the trait of interest. We monitored the changes in $\theta$ b and $\theta$ W, Q ST and G STq over successive generations of divergent and stabilizing selection, in simulations for an outcrossing species with extensive gene flow. The dynamics of these parameters are characterized by two phases. Initially, during the earliest generations, differentiation of the trait increases very rapidly and the principal and immediate driver of Q ST is $\theta$ B. During subsequent generations, G STq increases steadily and makes an equal contribution to Q ST. These results show that selection first captures beneficial allelic associations at different loci at different populations, and then targets changes in allelic frequencies. The same patterns are observed when environmental change modifies divergent selection, as shown by the very rapid response of theta;B to the changes of selection regimes. We compare our results with previous experimental findings and consider their relevance to the detection of molecular signatures of natural selection. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Niche differentiation is a key issue in the current debate on community assembly mechanisms. In highly diverse moist tropical forests, tree species sensitivity to canopy openness is thought to be a major axis in niche differentiation. In the past, the syndrome of traits driving the demographic trade-off involved in the niche-based theory of coexistence has always been established among species situated at the two extremities of the shade-tolerance gradient, even though most tropical tree species have intermediate light requirements. In addition, trait plasticity has seldom been linked to tropical tree species distribution along environmental gradients. This article examines covariations between leaf traits, whole-plant traits and niche parameters among 14 tree species with intermediate light requirements in French Guiana and across a range of canopy openness. Each functional trait measured under field conditions was characterized by a median value and a degree of plasticity expressed under contrasting light regimes. Niche differentiation was characterized in terms of spatial light gradient. We first examined covariations between functional traits then explored to what degree the median value and plasticity in functional traits could predict light niche characteristics at the sapling stage and the ontogenetic change in light availability estimated by adult stature. Leaf mass per area (LMA) was positively correlated with leaf life span (LLS); species with higher LMA and higher LLS displayed lower diameter growth rates (GRs) and lower responsiveness to canopy gap at both whole-plant and population levels. This proved that the relationships previously established over a broader range of species held true within the narrow range of the light requirements covered. Height GR plasticity accounted for 49{\%} of the variation in light niche optimum. LMA plasticity, unlike LLS plasticity, was significantly correlated with light niche breadth and adult stature. Synthesis. This study demonstrates the relevance of considering the phenotypic plasticity in functional traits in community ecology, particularly for quantifying breadth of species distribution over environmental gradients. Our findings did not support Hubbell's hypothesis of functional equivalence and suggest that even a rather subtle variation in forest canopy disturbance promotes the coexistence of tropical tree species. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Habitat difference is an important mechanism for maintenance of tree diversity in tropical forests. The first step in studies of habitat difference is to statistically analyze whether the spatial distributions of tree populations are skewed to species-specific habitats; this is called a habitat association test. We propose a novel habitat association test on the basis of the probability of tree occurrence along a continuous habitat variable. The test uses torus shift simulations to obtain a statistical significance level. We applied this test to 55 common dipterocarp species in a 52-ha plot of a Bornean forest to assess habitat associations along an elevation gradient. The results were compared to those of three existing habitat association tests using the same torus shift simulations. The results were considerably different from one another. In particular, the results of two existing tests using discrete habitat variables varied with differences in habitat definitions, specifically, differences in elevation break points, and the number of habitat classes. Thus, definitions of habitats must be taken into account when habitat association tests with discrete habitat variables are used. Analyses of artificial populations independent of habitat showed that all of the tests used were robust with respect to spatial autocorrelation in tree distributions, although one existing test had a higher risk of Type I errors, probably due to the use of multiple tests of significance. Power analysis of artificial populations in which distributions were skewed to certain elevations showed that the novel test had comparable statistical power to the most powerful existing test. Statistical power was affected not by the total number of a given tree but by the number of clumps in a plot, suggesting that {\textgreater}5 clumps were required for a reliable result. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Plant growth plays a key role in the functioning of the terrestrial biosphere, and there have been substantial efforts to understand why growth varies among species. To this end, a large number of experimental analyses have been undertaken; however, the emergent patterns between growth rate and its components are often contradictory. We believe that these conflicting results are a consequence of the way growth is measured. Growth is typically characterized by relative growth rate (RGR); however, RGR often declines as organisms get larger, making it difficult to compare species of different sizes. To overcome this problem, we advocate using nonlinear mixed-effects models so that RGR can be calculated at a standard size, and we present easily implemented methods for doing this. We then present new methods for analyzing the traditional components of RGR that explicitly allow for the fact that log (RGR) is the sum of its components. These methods provide an exact decomposition of the variance in log (RGR). Finally, we use simple analytical and simulation approaches to explore the effect of size variation on growth and its components and show that the relative importance of the components of RGR is influenced by the extent to which analyses standardize for plant size. {\textcopyright} 2010 by The University of Chicago.},

@article{Ghalambor2007,
abstract = {1. The role of phenotypic plasticity in evolution has historically been a contentious issue because of debate over whether plasticity shields genotypes from selection or generates novel opportunities for selection to act. Because plasticity encompasses diverse adaptive and non-adaptive responses to environmental variation, no single conceptual framework adequately predicts the diverse roles of plasticity in evolutionary change. 2. Different types of phenotypic plasticity can uniquely contribute to adaptive evolution when populations are faced with new or altered environments. Adaptive plasticity should promote establishment and persistence in a new environment, but depending on how close the plastic response is to the new favoured phenotypic optimum dictates whether directional selection will cause adaptive divergence between populations. Further, non-adaptive plasticity in response to stressful environments can result in a mean phenotypic response being further away from the favoured optimum or alternatively increase the variance around the mean due to the expression of cryptic genetic variation. The expression of cryptic genetic variation can facilitate adaptive evolution if by chance it results in a fitter phenotype. 3. We conclude that adaptive plasticity that places populations close enough to a new phenotypic optimum for directional selection to act is the only plasticity that predictably enhances fitness and is most likely to facilitate adaptive evolution on ecological time-scales in new environments. However, this type of plasticity is likely to be the product of past selection on variation that may have been initially non-adaptive. 4. We end with suggestions on how future empirical studies can be designed to better test the importance of different kinds of plasticity to adaptive evolution.},

abstract = {This study examined variation in leaf traits and water relations in 12 evergreen and semideciduous woody species that occur in both seasonal wet and dry forests in Costa Rica and compared intra-specific leaf-trait correlations to those found in inter-specific global studies. The following traits were measured in both forests across seasons for 2 years: leaf nitrogen (N), leaf carbon (C), specific leaf area (SLA), toughness, cuticle thickness, leaf thickness, and leaf lifespan (LLS). Leaf water potential (LWP) and water content (LWC) were measured as indices of plant available water. Canopy openness, soil moisture, and herbivory were also measured to compare environmental variation across sites. Although species contributed the greatest amount to variation in traits, season, forest, and their interaction had a large influence on patterns of intra-specific leaf-trait variation. Leaf traits that contributed most to variation across sites were C, LWP, leaf thickness, and SLA. Traits that contributed most to variation across seasons were leaf toughness, LWP, and LWC. Furthermore, leaf traits were more correlated (i. e., number and strength of correlations) in the dry than in the wet forest. In contrast to results from global literature syntheses, there was no correlation between LLS and N, or LLS and SLA. Both light and water availability vary seasonally and may be causing variation in a number of leaf traits, specifically those that relate to water relations and leaf economics. Strong seasonality may cause leaf-trait relationships at the local scale to differ from those documented in continental and global-scale studies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Even moderate habitat destruction is predicted to cause time-delayed but deterministic extinction of the dominant competitor in remnant patches. Further species are predicted to become extinct, in order from the best to the poorest competitors, as habitat destruction increases. Moreover, the more fragmented a habitat already is, the greater is the number of extinctions caused by added destruction.

Understanding the genetic basis of plant adaptation to wildfire is crucial, because impending climate change will involve fire regime changes worldwide. We studied the molecular genetic basis of serotiny, a fire-related trait, in Mediterranean maritime pine using association genetics. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) set was used to identify genotype : phenotype associations in situ in an unstructured natural population of maritime pine (eastern Iberian Peninsula) under a mixed-effects model framework. RR-BLUP was used to build predictive models for serotiny in this region. Model prediction power outside the focal region was tested using independent range-wide serotiny data. Seventeen SNPs were potentially associated with serotiny, explaining approximately 29{\%} of the trait phenotypic variation in the eastern Iberian Peninsula. Similar prediction power was found for nearby geographical regions from the same maternal lineage, but not for other genetic lineages. Association genetics for ecologically relevant traits evaluated in situ is an attractive approach for forest trees provided that traits are under strong genetic control and populations are unstructured, with large phenotypic variability. This will help to extend the research focus to ecological keystone non-model species in their natural environments, where polymorphisms acquired their adaptive value.},

abstract = {Because reducing aboveground competition for photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) increases growth and survival rates of tropical rain forest seedlings, below-ground competition for nutrients is often assumed to be of little or no importance. We tested this assumption. We measured the growth, over one year, of seedlings of Aspidosperma carapanauba (shade tolerator) and Dinizia excelsa (light demander) transplanted into understory (high aboveground competition; 1{\%} incoming photosynthetic photon flux density [PPFD]) and single treefall gap areas (lower aboveground competition; 6{\%} PPFD in centers of gaps) without and with trenches cut around plots (high and low belowground competition). Over the wetter six months, location in gaps significantly increased relative height growth rates by 320{\%} and 570{\%}, and relative leaf production rates by 190{\%} and 280{\%}, while trenching significantly increased height by 330{\%} and 520{\%}, and leaf production by 170{\%} and 260{\%}, for Aspidosperma and Dinizia, respectively, with significant interactions between treatments. Trenching approximately doubled height growth in the understory. Leaf loss rates were unaffected by either treatment but were 3.7 times higher in Dinizia compared with Aspidosperma. Aspidosperma could persist in the understory, as leaf production and loss were balanced at 0.60{\%} PPFD, whereas Dinizia could not, as it required 2.4{\%} PPFD. Reducing either aboveground competition or belowground competition allowed Dinizia to persist as leaf production was increased above unchanging leaf loss rates. Gap and trenching treatments both significantly reduced mortality rates in Dinizia. Location in gaps significantly reduced mortality rates in Aspidosperma. Both species significantly increased allocation to leaves and significantly decreased allocation to roots in response to trenching. The increased growth in the wet season caused by trenching, and increased foliar nitrogen and phosphorus amount, showed that both species were probably competing with adult trees for nutrients as well as PAR. We deduced that phosphorus did not limit growth; however, we could not deduce which nutrient did limit growth. Given that 60-70{\%} of the world's tropical rain forests occur on low-fertility oxisols, intense adult-juvenile competition both aboveground and belowground may be the norm, not the exception.},

abstract = {Old-growth tropical forests are being extensively deforested and fragmented worldwide. Yet forest recovery through succession has led to an expansion of secondary forests in human-modified tropical landscapes (HMTLs). Secondary forests thus emerge as a potential repository for tropical biodiversity, and also as a source of essential ecosystem functions and services in HMTLs. Such critical roles are controversial, however, as they depend on successional, landscape and socio-economic dynamics, which can vary widely within and across landscapes and regions. Understanding the main drivers of successional pathways of disturbed tropical forests is critically needed for improving management, conservation, and restoration strategies. Here, we combine emerging knowledge from tropical forest succession, forest fragmentation and landscape ecology research to identify the main driving forces shaping successional pathways at different spatial scales. We also explore causal connections between land-use dynamics and the level of predictability of successional pathways, and examine potential implications of such connections to determine the importance of secondary forests for biodiversity conservation in HMTLs. We show that secondary succession (SS) in tropical landscapes is a multifactorial phenomenon affected by a myriad of forces operating at multiple spatio-temporal scales. SS is relatively fast and more predictable in recently modified landscapes and where well-preserved biodiversity-rich native forests are still present in the landscape. Yet the increasing variation in landscape spatial configuration and matrix heterogeneity in landscapes with intermediate levels of disturbance increases the uncertainty of successional pathways. In landscapes that have suffered extensive and intensive human disturbances, however, succession can be slow or arrested, with impoverished assemblages and reduced potential to deliver ecosystem functions and services. We conclude that: (i) succession must be examined using more comprehensive explanatory models, providing information about the forces affecting not only the presence but also the persistence of species and ecological groups, particularly of those taxa expected to be extirpated from HMTLs; (ii) SS research should integrate new aspects from forest fragmentation and landscape ecology research to address accurately the potential of secondary forests to serve as biodiversity repositories; and (iii) secondary forest stands, as a dynamic component of HMTLs, must be incorporated as key elements of conservation planning; i.e. secondary forest stands must be actively managed (e.g. using assisted forest restoration) according to conservation goals at broad spatial scales.},

Regression analysis provides the most comprehensive sensitivity measure and is commonly utilized to build response surfaces that approximate complex models.},

abstract = {Abstract The ability to withstand disturbance (resistance) and the ability to recover biomass following disturbance (resilience) were investigated in Australian wet tropical rainforest tree species. These two attributes are expected to be negatively correlated, because investment of biomass in structural support (conferring resistance) results in trees exhibiting high wood densities and slow growth rates, and vice versa. We examined species' responses to disturbance caused by a severe tropical cyclone to test this hypothesized trade-off. We assessed cyclone damage in six species in three Mabi rainforest fragments on the Atherton Tablelands. Species differed in the proportion of individuals within four damage categories (minor damage, severe branch damage, snapped, uprooted). Resistance was positively related to wood density. We found a positive correlation between the proportion of trees experiencing minor damage only and wood density, supporting the hypothesized association between resistance and mechanical strength. Among the subset of trees in which stems snapped, rates of resprouting differed between species and were highest in low wood density species and lowest in species with highest wood density. Resilience, characterized as the ability to recover biomass following disturbance and estimated as growth rate standardized for stem diameter at breast height (g day−1 {\textperiodcentered} mm−1), was negatively related to wood density. Thus, species with low wood densities were more likely to suffer stem and branch damage owing to cyclonic winds, but also demonstrated highest resprouting and fastest responses in terms of redeveloping biomass in the 8 months following disturbance. This suggests that a species' position along the resistance–resilience spectrum can be predicted by mean wood density, which may allow managers to predict species' responses to future cyclones. Our findings also provide mechanistic evidence for the ‘direct regeneration' model of post-cyclone succession, where response is characterized by resprouting and species composition is unchanged.},

abstract = {Tropical forests are global centres of biodiversity and carbon storage. Many tropical countries aspire to protect forest to fulfil biodiversity and climate mitigation policy targets, but the conservation strategies needed to achieve these two functions depend critically on the tropical forest tree diversity-carbon storage relationship. Assessing this relationship is challenging due to the scarcity of inventories where carbon stocks in aboveground biomass and species identifications have been simultaneously and robustly quantified. Here, we compile a unique pan-tropical dataset of 360 plots located in structurally intact old-growth closed-canopy forest, surveyed using standardised methods, allowing a multi-scale evaluation of diversity-carbon relationships in tropical forests. Diversity-carbon relationships among all plots at 1 ha scale across the tropics are absent, and within continents are either weak (Asia) or absent (Amazonia, Africa). A weak positive relationship is detectable within 1 ha plots, indicating that diversity effects in tropical forests may be scale dependent. The absence of clear diversity-carbon relationships at scales relevant to conservation planning means that carbon-centred conservation strategies will inevitably miss many high diversity ecosystems. As tropical forests can have any combination of tree diversity and carbon stocks both require explicit consideration when optimising policies to manage tropical carbon and biodiversity.},

abstract = {The use of molecular data to reconstruct the history of divergence and gene flow between populations of closely related taxa represents a challenging problem. It has been proposed that the long-standing debate about the geography of speciation can be resolved by comparing the likelihoods of a model of isolation with migration and a model of secondary contact. However, data are commonly only fit to a model of isolation with migration and rarely tested against the secondary contact alternative. Furthermore, most demographic inference methods have neglected variation in introgression rates and assume that the gene flow parameter (Nm) is similar among loci. Here, we show that neglecting this source of variation can give misleading results. We analysed DNA sequences sampled from populations of the marine mussels, Mytilus edulis and M. galloprovincialis, across a well-studied mosaic hybrid zone in Europe and evaluated various scenarios of speciation, with or without variation in introgression rates, using an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach. Models with heterogeneous gene flow across loci always outperformed models assuming equal migration rates irrespective of the history of gene flow being considered. By incorporating this heterogeneity, the best-supported scenario was a long period of allopatric isolation during the first three-quarters of the time since divergence followed by secondary contact and introgression during the last quarter. By contrast, constraining migration to be homogeneous failed to discriminate among any of the different models of gene flow tested. Our simulations thus provide statistical support for the secondary contact scenario in the European Mytilus hybrid zone that the standard coalescent approach failed to confirm. Our results demonstrate that genomic variation in introgression rates can have profound impacts on the biological conclusions drawn from inference methods and needs to be incorporated in future studies. {\textcopyright} 2014 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.},

abstract = {Two hypotheses to explain potentially high forest biodiversity have different implications for the number and kinds of species that can coexist and the potential loss of biodiversity in the absence of speciation. The first hypothesis involves stabilizing mechanisms, which include tradeoffs between species in terms of their capacities to disperse to sites where competition is weak(1-4), to exploit abundant resources effectively(5,6) and to compete for scarce resources(7). Stabilization results because competitors thrive at different times and places. An alternative, 'neutral model' suggests that stabilizing mechanisms may be superfluous. This explanation emphasizes 'equalizing' mechanisms(8), because competitive exclusion of similar species is slow. Lack of ecologically relevant differences means that abundances experience random 'neutral drift', with slow extinction(9-11). The relative importance of these two mechanisms is unknown, because assumptions and predictions involve broad temporal and spatial scales. Here we demonstrate that predictions of neutral drift are testable using palaeodata. The results demonstrate strong stabilizing forces. By contrast with the neutral prediction of increasing variance among sites over time, we show that variances in post-Glacial tree abundances among sites stabilize rapidly, and abundances remain coherent over broad geographical scales.},

abstract = {When pairwise differences (relatedness) between species are numerically given, the average of the species differences weighted by relative frequencies can be used as a species diversity index. This paper first theoretically develops the indices of this type, then applies them to forestry data. As examples of diversity indices, this paper explores the taxonomic diversity and the newly introduced amino acid diversity, which is a modification of the nucleotide diversity in genetics. The first, mathematical part shows that both indices can be decomposed into three inner factors; evenness of relative frequencies (=the Simpson index), the simple average over species differences regardless of relative frequencies, and the taxonomic or genetic balance in relative frequencies. The taxonomic diversity has another decomposition: the sum over the Simpson indices at all the taxonomic levels. The second part examines the effects of different forest management techniques on diversity. It is shown that a thinning operation for promoting survival of specific desirable species also contributed to increasing the taxonomic diversity. If we calculated only conventional indices that do not incorporate species relatedness, we would simply conclude that the thinning did not significantly affect the diversity. The theoretical developments of the first part complement the result, leading us to a better interpretation about contrasting vegetation structures. The mathematical results also reveal that the amino acid diversity involves redundant species, which is undesirable when measuring diversity; hence, this index is used to demonstrates crucial points when we introduce species relatedness. The results suggest further possibilities of applying diversity indices incorporating species differences to a variety of ecological studies.

abstract = {Summary: A key issue in plant/herbivore interaction research is to understand which plant traits drive differences in herbivore damage. Variation in chemical, physical or phenological traits of plants may all modulate the degree of herbivore damage among species and individuals, yet the relative importance of these factors is still subject to debate, particularly in species-rich systems such as tropical rain forests. To address this issue, we quantified leaf herbivore damage in 28 common tree species of the Yasun{\'{i}} forest dynamic plot (YFDP) in the Ecuadorian Amazon over 11 months. Census data from the YFDP allowed us to quantify several aspects of tree ecology potentially affecting herbivory including leaf turnover and spatial distribution patterns. We measured six chemical, eight physical and four ecological traits of the focal species. Using a combination of multivariate analyses and phylogenetic generalized linear regression model (PGLS), we assessed trade-offs between physical and chemical traits and the relative effect of all these traits on leaf herbivore damage. Herbivore damage was highly variable among species and individuals, with leaves on average displaying damage over 13.4{\%} (2.5-29.5{\%}) of their area. We found no significant trade-off between physical and chemical defences for the 28 studied tree species. Overall, leaf size, shearing resistance, cellulose, ash content and leaf size × ash were the best predictors of herbivore damage. Surprisingly, condensed tannins and latex did not significantly correlate with herbivore damage. In addition, we found no relationships between herbivory and local tree density. However, we did find a weak effect of tree clustering and strong effect of tree leaf turnover rates on herbivore damage. Synthesis. In the western Amazon, leaves are defended against herbivores through a combination of physical (toughness), chemical (toughness-related elements), and phenological (rapid leaf replacement) characteristics that do not appear to be subject to obvious trade-offs. Conventional strategies, such as condensed tannins or latex, do not seem to be strongly involved as a defence against herbivores in this community.

The diversity of plant functional traits in forests, especially physiological traits related to water (hydraulic) transport, may have a critical role in land–atmosphere feedback, particularly during drought. Here we combine 352 site-years of eddy covariance measurements from 40 forest sites, remote-sensing observations of plant water content and plant functional-trait data to test whether the diversity in plant traits affects the response of the ecosystem to drought. We find evidence that higher hydraulic diversity buffers variation in ecosystem flux during dry periods across temperate and boreal forests. Hydraulic traits were the predominant significant predictors of cross-site patterns in drought response. By contrast, standard leaf and wood traits, such as specific leaf area and wood density, had little explanatory power. Our results demonstrate that diversity in the hydraulic traits of trees mediates ecosystem resilience to drought and is likely to have an important role in future ecosystem–atmosphere feedback effects in a changing climate.},

abstract = {Additive genetic variance in relative fitness ($\sigma$A2(w)) is arguably the most important evolutionary parameter in a population because, by Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection (FTNS; Fisher RA. 1930. The genetical theory of natural selection. 1st ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press), it represents the rate of adaptive evolution. However, to date, there are few estimates of $\sigma$A2(w) in natural populations. Moreover, most of the available estimates rely on Gaussian assumptions inappropriate for fitness data, with unclear consequences. "Generalized linear animal models" (GLAMs) tend to be more appropriate for fitness data, but they estimate parameters on a transformed ("latent") scale that is not directly interpretable for inferences on the data scale. Here we exploit the latest theoretical developments to clarify how best to estimate quantitative genetic parameters for fitness. Specifically, we use computer simulations to confirm a recently developed analog of the FTNS in the case when expected fitness follows a log-normal distribution. In this situation, the additive genetic variance in absolute fitness on the latent log-scale ($\sigma$A2(l)) equals ($\sigma$A2(w)) on the data scale, which is the rate of adaptation within a generation. However, due to inheritance distortion, the change in mean relative fitness between generations exceeds $\sigma$A2(l) and equals (exp($\sigma$A2(l))-1). We illustrate why the heritability of fitness is generally low and is not a good measure of the rate of adaptation. Finally, we explore how well the relevant parameters can be estimated by animal models, comparing Gaussian models with Poisson GLAMs. Our results illustrate 1) the correspondence between quantitative genetics and population dynamics encapsulated in the FTNS and its log-normal-analog and 2) the appropriate interpretation of GLAM parameter estimates.},

Location: Forest patcheswithin a native grasslandmatrix in southern Brazil. Methods: We recorded saplings in community plots across a canopy openness gradient in forest patches and described each of the 1129 individuals using SLA. First, we partitioned trait variation into BSV andWSV irrespective of co-occur- rence in plots. Then, using the community data, we partitioned the total varia- tion of community-weighted trait means (CWM) and Rao's functional diversity (FD) into components explained by canopy openness, species turnover and WSV.We also partitioned the effects ofWSV between and within plots on FD. Finally, we explored the responses of CWM and FD to the gradient using the whole trait variability, only BSVor onlyWSV. Results: Specific leaf area presented a substantial proportion of variationwithin species (37{\%}), although it variedmore between species (63{\%}). Species turnover andWSV explained 48{\%}and 19{\%}of the variation inCWMacross the gradient, respectively. Species turnover and WSV explained 51{\%} and 45{\%} of the varia- tion in FD across the gradient, respectively. SLA varied within species more along the gradient than within communities. Within-species variability enhanced shifts in CWM and FD across the gradient. Canopy openness signifi- cantly predicted CWMat all levels, and FDat all but the within-species level. Conclusions: Plastic responses of speciesmirrored the average response of com- munities to the environmental gradient. Within-species trait variability enhanced themean plant responses to environmental variation aswell as niche partitioning, and was especially important in enabling species to establish in a wider portion of the environmental gradient.

abstract = {This study was designed to explicitly formulate the effect of census interval and plot size on the variability of descriptors of tropical forest structure (stand density, basal area, aboveground biomass [AGB]) and dynamic (tree growth, mortality and recruitment rates, biomass fluxes). A unique dataset from a broad plot network (37.5ha) surveyed every 2yr over a 16yr period was used to develop and parameterize a new statistical model predicting the coefficients of variation for each forest descriptor. More than 90 percent of the inherent variability of these coefficients was predicted using a simple model including plot size and census interval in a Bayesian modeling framework. All descriptors of forest structure varied by {\textless}10 percent for plot sizes {\textgreater}2ha. Among the descriptors of forest dynamics, AGB loss was the most variable. The number of 6.25ha plots required to estimate its mean, over a 16yr period, within a 20 percent error of the mean remains above four. This contrasts with a relative constant flux of biomass entering the plot through tree growth and tree recruitment. Tree growth was remarkably well estimated with {\textless}15 percent variability for a 2yr census in a plot of 2ha. This study provides an easy method to assess dataset limitations in efforts to estimate descriptors of forest structure and dynamic, which is of primary importance to decipher any clear consequences of global change in tropical forests.

abstract = {1. Current thinking holds that wood density mediates a tradeoff between strength and economy of construction, with higher wood density providing higher strength but at higher cost. 2. Yet the further away wood fibres are from the central axis of the trunk, the more they increase the strength of the trunk; thus, a fat trunk of low-density wood can achieve greater strength at lower construction cost than a thin trunk of high-density wood. 3. What then are the countervailing advantages of high wood density? 4. We hypothesize that high wood density is associated with lower maintenance costs due to lower trunk surface area, as surface area correlates with maintenance respiration. 5. This advantage would be particularly important to long-lived trees and could in part explain why they tend to have high wood density. 6. High wood density has also been associated with lower risk of trunk breakage, xylem implosion and pathogen invasion, but we argue that these relationships are not causal and instead reflect correlated selection on other traits of value to long-lived trees. 7. This revaluation of the costs and benefits of high wood density has important implications for understanding tree life-history evolution, functional diversity, forest carbon stocks and the impacts of global change.},

Despite broad interest in ecological drift, ecologists have little experimental evidence of its consequences in nature, where competitive forces modulate species abundances. We manipulated drift by imposing 40-fold variation in the size of experimentally assembled annual plant communities and holding their edge-to-interior ratios comparable. Drift over three generations was greater than predicted by neutral models, causing high extinction rates and fast divergence in composition among smaller communities. Competitive asymmetries drove populations of most species to small enough sizes that demographic stochasticity could markedly influence dynamics, increasing the importance of drift in communities. The strong effects of drift occurred despite stabilizing niche differences, which cause species to have greater population growth rates when ...},

abstract = {Plant species delimitation within tropical ecosystems is often difficult because of the lack of diagnostic morphological characters that are clearly visible. The development of an integrated approach, which utilizes several different types of markers (both morphological and molecular), would be extremely useful in this context. Here we have addressed species delimitation of sympatric tropical tree species that belong to Carapa spp. (Meliaceae) in Central Africa. We adopted a population genetics approach, sampling numerous individuals from three locations where sympatric Carapa species are known to exist. Comparisons between morphological markers (the presence or absence of characters, leaf-shape traits) and molecular markers (chloroplast sequences, ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) sequences, and nuclear microsatellites) demonstrated the following: (i) a strong correlation between morphological and nuclear markers; (ii) despite substantial polymorphism, the inability of chloroplast DNA to discriminate between species, suggesting that cytoplasmic markers represent ineffective DNA barcodes; (iii) lineage sorting effects when using ITS sequences; and (iv) a complex evolutionary history within the genus Carapa, which includes frequent inter-specific gene flow. Our results support the use of a population genetics approach, based on ultra-polymorphic markers, to address species delimitation within complex taxonomic groups. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

We evaluate the environmental impacts of such logging and conclude that natural timber-production forests typically retain most of their biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions, as well as their carbon, climatic, and soil-hydrological ecosystem services. Unfortunately, the value of production forests is often overlooked, leaving them vulnerable to further degradation including post-logging clearing, fires, and hunting. Because logged tropical forests are extensive, functionally diverse, and provide many ecosystem services, efforts to expand their role in conservation strategies are urgently needed. Key priorities include improving harvest practices to reduce negative impacts on ecosystem functions and services, and preventing the rapid conversion and loss of logged forests. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundant genetic variant found in vertebrates and invertebrates. SNP discovery has become a highly automated, robust and relatively inexpensive process allowing the identification of many thousands of mutations for model and non-model organisms. Annotating large numbers of SNPs can be a difficult and complex process. Many tools available are optimised for use with organisms densely sampled for SNPs, such as humans. There are currently few tools available that are species non-specific or support non-model organism data.Results: Here we present SNPdat, a high throughput analysis tool that can provide a comprehensive annotation of both novel and known SNPs for any organism with a draft sequence and annotation. Using a dataset of 4,566 SNPs identified in cattle using high-throughput DNA sequencing we demonstrate the annotations performed and the statistics that can be generated by SNPdat.Conclusions: SNPdat provides users with a simple tool for annotation of genomes that are either not supported by other tools or have a small number of annotated SNPs available. SNPdat can also be used to analyse datasets from organisms which are densely sampled for SNPs. As a command line tool it can easily be incorporated into existing SNP discovery pipelines and fills a niche for analyses involving non-model organisms that are not supported by many available SNP annotation tools. SNPdat will be of great interest to scientists involved in SNP discovery and analysis projects, particularly those with limited bioinformatics experience. {\textcopyright} 2013 Doran and Creevey; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {We introduce a method to help identify how the genetic diversity of a species within a geographic region might have arisen. This problem appears, for example, in the context of identifying refugia in phylogeography, and in the conservation of biodiversity where it is a factor in nature reserve selection. Complementing current methods for measuring genetic diversity, we analyze pairwise distances between the haplotypes of a species found in a geographic region and derive a quantity, called haplotype connectivity, that aims to capture how divergent the haplotypes are relative to one another. We propose using haplotype connectivity to indicate whether, for geographic regions that harbor a highly diverse collection of haplotypes, diversity evolved inside a region over a long period of time (a "hot-spot") or is the result of a more recent mixture (a "melting-pot"). We describe how the haplotype connectivity for a collection of haplotypes can be computed efficiently and briefly discuss some related optimization problems that arise in this context. We illustrate the applicability of our method using two previously published data sets of a species of beetle from the genus Brachyderes and a species of tree from the genus Pinus. {\textcopyright} 2010 Nguyen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Here, we develop and apply a new generic modelling approach (AdaptR) that incorporates adaptive capacity through physiological limits, phenotypic plasticity, evolutionary adaptation and dispersal into a species distribution modelling framework. Using AdaptR to predict change in the distribution of 17 species of Australian fruit flies (Drosophilidae), we show that accounting for adaptive capacity reduces projected range losses by up to 33{\%} by 2105. We identify where local adaptation is likely to occur and apply sensitivity analyses to identify the critical factors of interest when parameters are uncertain. Our study suggests some species could be less vulnerable than previously thought, and indicates that spatiotemporal adaptive models could help improve management interventions that support increased species' resilience to climate change.},

abstract = {Tree mortality in tropical forests is a complex ecological process for which modelling approaches need to be improved to better understand, and then predict, the evolution of tree mortality in response to global change. The mortality model introduced here computes an individual probability of dying for each tree in a community. The mortality model uses the ontogenetic stage of the tree because youngest and oldest trees are more likely to die. Functional traits are integrated as proxies of the ecological strategies of the trees to permit generalization among all species in the community. Data used to parametrize the model were collected at Paracou study site, a tropical rain forest in French Guiana, where 20,408 trees have been censused for 18 years. A Bayesian framework was used to select useful covariates and to estimate the model parameters. This framework was developed to deal with sources of uncertainty, including the complexity of the mortality process itself and the field data, especially historical data for which taxonomic determinations were uncertain. Uncertainty about the functional traits was also considered, to maximize the information they contain. Four functional traits were strong predictors of tree mortality: wood density, maximum height, laminar toughness and stem and branch orientation, which together distinguished the light-demanding, fast-growing trees from slow-growing trees with lower mortality rates. Our modelling approach formalizes a complex ecological problem and offers a relevant mathematical framework for tropical ecologists to process similar uncertain data at the community level.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence indicates that current dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) have suffered from insufficient realism and are difficult to improve, particularly because they are built on plant functional type (PFT) schemes. Therefore, new approaches, such as plant trait-based methods, are urgently needed to replace PFT schemes when predicting the distribution of vegetation and investigating vegetation sensitivity. As an important direction towards constructing next-generation DGVMs based on plant functional traits, we propose a novel approach for modelling vegetation distributions and analysing vegetation sensitivity through trait-climate relationships in China. The results demonstrated that a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) trained with a LMA-Nmass-LAI data combination yielded an accuracy of 72.82{\%} in simulating vegetation distribution, providing more detailed parameter information regarding community structures and ecosystem functions. The new approach also performed well in analyses of vegetation sensitivity to different climatic scenarios. Although the trait-climate relationship is not the only candidate useful for predicting vegetation distributions and analysing climatic sensitivity, it sheds new light on the development of next-generation trait-based DGVMs.},

abstract = {1. One of the earliest hypotheses to explain high tropical forest diversity proposes that species are differentially specialized in their germination or growth and survival to particular habitats. 2.I examined evidence for habitat associations in seedling density and demography in 9years of seedling dynamics data from Yasun{\'{i}} National Park, Ecuador, a lowland rain forest where previous studies have demonstrated habitat preferences among adult trees. I included 136 species or morphospecies from multiple annual seedling cohorts with known age of recruitment. 3.Approximately 90{\%} of the species examined demonstrated negative or positive associations with one or more topographic habitats in their recruitment, growth and/or mortality at some point in the study, and approximately 60{\%} of species had significant associations in at least half of the census periods studied. The survival of newly recruited seedlings varied among seedlings in response to topographic gradients, indicating the potential for species to partition habitat niches at a young stage. 4.There was significant inter-annual variation in seedling habitat associations, indicating the characteristics of the topographic niche important to seedling performance change through time. This variability alone can contribute to the maintenance of species diversity through storage effects. While associations may also be weak or ephemeral, the seedling dynamics for many species supported the possibility that associations seen in adult populations develop through differential mortality across habitats as seedlings. 5.Synthesis. That species' seedlings perform differently among topographic habitats and that these differences are detectable very early on in a plant's life indicate the potential for the abiotic environment to mediate or exaggerate the roles of other mechanisms in influencing the composition of the understorey seedling assemblage. This study demonstrates the widespread occurrence of habitat associations at the seedling stage for large number of woody species in a very diverse Amazonian forest. Differential performance among habitat types and inter-annual variation in seedling dynamics contribute to the maintenance of species diversity in tropical forests. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author.

abstract = {Variation in resource availability can lead to phenotypic plasticity in the traits comprising the world-wide leaf economics spectrum (LES), potentially impairing plant function and complicating the use of tabulated values for LES traits in ecological studies. We compared 14 Carex (Cyperaceae) species in a factorial experiment (unshaded/shaded × sufficient/insufficient P) to analyze how changes in the network of allometric scaling relationships among LES traits influenced growth under favorable and resource-limited conditions. Changes in leaf mass per area (LMA) shifted the scaling relationships among LES traits expressed per unit area vs mass in ways that helped to sustain growth under resource limitation. Increases in area-normalized photosynthetic capacity and foliar nitrogen (N) were correlated with increased growth, offsetting losses associated with mass-normalized dark respiration and foliar N. These shifts increased the contributions to growth associated with photosynthetic N-use efficiency and the N : P ratio. Plasticity in LMA is at the hub of the functional role of the LES as an integrated and resilient complex system that balances the relationships among area- and mass-based aspects of gas exchange and foliar nutrient traits to sustain at least some degree of plant growth under differing availabilities of above- and below-ground resources.},

Traditionally, ecologists have explored linkages between the severity and type of disturbance and the taxonomic structure of communities. Recent advances in the application of species traits, to assess the functional structure of communities, have provided an alternative approach that responds rapidly and consistently across taxa and ecosystems to multiple disturbances. Importantly, trait-based metrics may provide advanced warning of disturbance to ecosystems because they do not need species loss to be reactive. Here, we synthesize empirical evidence and present a theoretical framework, based on species positions in a functional space, as a tool to reveal the complex nature of change in disturbed ecosystems.},

In this review we discuss the biological and statistical considerations that underpin a successful analysis or otherwise. The relevance of biological factors including effect size, sample size, genetic heterogeneity, genomic confounding, linkage disequilibrium and spurious association, and statistical tools to account for these are presented. GWAS can offer a valuable first insight into trait architecture or candidate loci for subsequent validation.},
annote = {- GWAS overcome TQL limits but with other drawbacks
- GWAS need to account population genetic structure
- GWAS can be based on mixed models (MM)
- GWAS detect well few loci with large effects but not the contrary
- GWAS rely on phenotypic variance determined by allelic variants effect size and frequency, thus both rare variants and small effect size present problems for GWAS
- genetic heterogeneity reduce discovery power
- disentanglement of causative variants from linked neutral markers difficult
- missing or low quality data is a major issue, overcomed by imputation of missing data infered from other individuals haplotypes or with uncertainty assesment by calculating a probability score for each SNP then used to waigh regressions
- mixed models reduce false positive associations including individuals genetic relations or kinship as a random term in the model
- most basic and often informative approach in GWAS are a correction for mul-tiple testing (usually a 5{\%} Bonferroni threshold is used) and inspection of Q-Q plots and Manhattan plots for evidence of P value inflation, but the main limitation of these corrections is the assumption that every SNP tested is independent
- missing heritability refers to the portion of genetic variance not explained by singificant SNPs},

abstract = {We developed a Bayesian genomic cline model to study the genetic architecture of adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation between hybridizing lineages. This model quantifies locus-specific patterns of introgression with two cline parameters that describe the probability of locus-specific ancestry as a function of genome-wide admixture. 'Outlier' loci with extreme patterns of introgression relative to most of the genome can be identified. These loci are potentially associated with adaptive divergence or reproductive isolation. We simulated genetic data for admixed populations that included neutral introgression, as well as loci that were subject to directional, epistatic or underdominant selection, and analysed these data using the Bayesian genomic cline model. Under many demographic conditions, underdominance or directional selection had detectable and predictable effects on cline parameters, and 'outlier' loci were greatly enriched for genetic regions affected by selection. We also analysed previously published genetic data from two transects through a hybrid zone between Mus domesticus and M. musculus. We found considerable variation in rates of introgression across the genome and particularly low rates of introgression for two X-linked markers. There were similarities and differences in patterns of introgression between the two transects, which likely reflects a combination of stochastic variability because of genetic drift and geographic variation in the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation. By providing a robust framework to quantify and compare patterns of introgression among genetic regions and populations, the Bayesian genomic cline model will advance our understanding of the genetics of reproductive isolation and the speciation process. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Enquist2015a,
abstract = {Aim: More powerful tests of biodiversity theories need to move beyond species richness and explicitly focus on mechanisms generating diversity via trait composition. The rise of trait-based ecology has led to an increased focus on the distribution and dynamics of traits across broad geographic and climatic gradients and how these distributions influence ecosystem function. However, a general theory of trait-based ecology, that can apply across different scales (e.g. species that differ in size) and gradients (e.g. temperature), has yet to be formulated. While research focused on metabolic and allometric scaling theory provides the basis for such a theory, it does not explicitly account for differences in traits within and across taxa, such as variation in the optimal temperature for growth. Here we synthesize trait-based and metabolic scaling approaches into a framework that we term 'Trait Driver Theory' or TDT. It shows that the shape and dynamics of trait and size distributions can be linked to fundamental drivers of community assembly and how the community will respond to future drivers. To assess predictions and assumptions of TDT, we review several theoretical studies and recent empirical studies spanning local and biogeographic gradients. Further, we analyze how the shift in trait distributions influences ecosystem processes across an elevational gradient and a 140-year-long ecological experiment. We show that TDT provides a baseline for (i) recasting the predictions of ecological theories based on species richness in terms of the shape of trait distributions and (ii) integrating how specific traits, including body size, and functional diversity then 'scale up' to influence ecosystem functioning and the dynamics of species assemblages across climate gradients. Further, TDT offers a novel framework to integrate trait, metabolic/allometric, and species-richness-based approaches to better predict functional biogeography and how assemblages of species have and may respond to climate change.},

A rich theoretical and empirical population genetics literature has considerably clarified how the distribution of SI phenotypes translates into fitness differences among individuals by a combination of inbreeding avoidance and rare-allele advantage. At the same time, the molecular mechanisms by which self-pollen is specifically recognized and rejected have been described in exquisite details in several model organisms, such that the genotype-to-phenotype map is also pretty well understood, notably in the Brassicaceae. Here, we review recent advances in these two fronts and illustrate how the joint availability of detailed characterization of genotype-to-phenotype and phenotype-to-fitness maps on a single genetic system (plant self-incompatibility) provides the opportunity to understand the evolutionary process in a unique perspective, bringing novel insight on general questions about the emergence, maintenance, and diversification of a complex genetic system.},

Here, we coupled field experiments under two contrasted climatic conditions to a plant population model describing competitive dynamics between 10 annual plant species in order to evaluate the associations of niche and fitness differences with 19 functional traits covering physiological, morphological and reproductive characteristics. We found a rich diversity of univariate and multidimensional relationships, in which outstand the primary role of traits related to water- and light-use-efficiency in modulating the determinants of competitive outcomes. Importantly, such traits and their plasticity promoted species coexistence across climatic conditions by enhancing stabilizing niche differences and by generating competitive trade-offs between species.

abstract = {Questions: How important is the choice of flow routing algorithm with respect to application of topographic wetness index (TWI) in vegetation ecology? Which flow routing algorithms are preferable for application in vegetation ecology? Location: Forests in three different regions of the Czech Republic. Methods: We used vegetation data from 521 georeferenced plots, recently sampled in a wide range of forest communities. From a digital elevation model, we calculated 11 variations of TWI for each plot with 11 different flow routing algorithms. We evaluated the performance of differently calculated TWI by (1) Spearman rank correlation with average Ellenberg indicator values for soil moisture, (2) Mantel correlation coefficient between dissimilarities of species composition and dissimilarities of TWI and (3) the amount of variation in species composition explained by canonical correspondence analysis. Results: The choice of flow routing algorithm had a considerable effect on the performance of TWI. Correlation with Ellenberg indicator values for soil moisture, Mantel correlation coefficient and explained variation doubled when the appropriate algorithm was used. In all regions, multiple flow routing algorithms performed best, while single flow routing algorithms performed worst. Conclusions: We recommend the multiple flow routing algorithms of Quinn et al. and Freeman for application in vegetation ecology. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

abstract = {Most adaption processes have a polygenic genetic basis, but even with the recent explosive growth of genomic data we are still lacking a unified framework describing the dynamics of selected alleles. Building on recent theoretical and empirical work we introduce the concept of adaptive architecture, which extends the genetic architecture of an adaptive trait by factors influencing its adaptive potential and population genetic principles. Because adaptation can be typically achieved by many different combinations of adaptive alleles (redundancy), we describe how two characteristics — heterogeneity among loci and non-parallelism between replicated populations — are hallmarks for the characterization of polygenic adaptation in evolving populations. We discuss how this unified framework can be applied to natural and experimental populations. Increased capacities for sequencing and genotyping are enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the genetics of adaptation for diverse species. In this Perspective, Barghi, Hermisson and Schl{\"{o}}tterer describe how polygenic adaptation can be studied using a framework of ‘adaptive architecture' that unifies principles from the traditionally disparate fields of quantitative genetics and molecular population genetics.},

Our method demonstrates improved control of both type I and type II error rates over other methods.

abstract = {Adaptive radiations are prominent components of the world's biodiversity. They comprise many species derived from one or a small number of ancestral species in a geologically short time that have diversified into a variety of ecological niches. Several authors have proposed that introgressive hybridization has been important in the generation of new morphologies and even new species, but how that happens throughout evolutionary history is not known. Interspecific gene exchange is expected to have greatest impact on variation if it occurs after species have diverged genetically and phenotypically but before genetic incompatibilities arise. We use a dated phylogeny to infer that populations of Darwin's finches in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos became more variable in morphological traits through time, consistent with the hybridization hypothesis, and then declined in variation after reaching a peak. Some species vary substantially more than others. Phylogenetic inferences of hybridization are supported by field observations of contemporary hybridization. Morphological effects of hybridization have been investigated on the small island of Daphne Major by documenting changes in hybridizing populations of Geospiza fortis and Geospiza scandens over a 30-y period. G. scandens showed more evidence of admixture than G. fortis. Beaks of G. scandens became progressively blunter, and while variation in length increased, variation in depth decreased. These changes imply independent effects of introgression on 2, genetically correlated, beak dimensions. Our study shows how introgressive hybridization can alter ecologically important traits, increase morphological variation as a radiation proceeds, and enhance the potential for future evolution in changing environments.},

abstract = {Background: GATK Best Practices workflows are widely used in large-scale sequencing projects and recommend post-alignment processing before variant calling. Two key post-processing steps include the computationally intensive local realignment around known INDELs and base quality score recalibration (BQSR). Both have been shown to reduce erroneous calls; however, the findings are mainly supported by the analytical pipeline that incorporates BWA and GATK UnifiedGenotyper. It is not known whether there is any benefit of post-processing and to what extent the benefit might be for pipelines implementing other methods, especially given that both mappers and callers are typically updated. Moreover, because sequencing platforms are upgraded regularly and the new platforms provide better estimations of read quality scores, the need for post-processing is also unknown. Finally, some regions in the human genome show high sequence divergence from the reference genome; it is unclear whether there is benefit from post-processing in these regions. Results: We used both simulated and NA12878 exome data to comprehensively assess the impact of post-processing for five or six popular mappers together with five callers. Focusing on chromosome 6p21.3, which is a region of high sequence divergence harboring the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system, we found that local realignment had little or no impact on SNP calling, but increased sensitivity was observed in INDEL calling for the Stampy+GATK UnifiedGenotyper pipeline. No or only a modest effect of local realignment was detected on the three haplotype-based callers and no evidence of effect on Novoalign. BQSR had virtually negligible effect on INDEL calling and generally reduced sensitivity for SNP calling that depended on caller, coverage and level of divergence. Specifically, for SAMtools and FreeBayes calling in the regions with low divergence, BQSR reduced the SNP calling sensitivity but improved the precision when the coverage is insufficient. However, in regions of high divergence (e.g., the HLA region), BQSR reduced the sensitivity of both callers with little gain in precision rate. For the other three callers, BQSR reduced the sensitivity without increasing the precision rate regardless of coverage and divergence level. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the gain from post-processing is not universal; rather, it depends on mapper and caller combination, and the benefit is influenced further by sequencing depth and divergence level. Our analysis highlights the importance of considering these key factors in deciding to apply the computationally intensive post-processing to Illumina exome data.},

abstract = {1. Ecologists often investigate co-occurrence patterns in multi-species data in order to gain insight into the ecological causes of observed co-occurrences. Apart from direct associations between the two species of interest, they may co-occur because of indirect effects, where both species respond to another variable, whether environmental or biotic (e.g. a mediator species). 2. A wide variety of methods are now available for modelling how environmental filtering drives species distributions. In contrast, methods for studying other causes of co-occurence are much more limited. "Graphical" methods, which can be used to study how mediator species impact co-occurrence patterns, have recently been proposed for use in ecology. However, available methods are limited to presence/ absence data or methods assuming multivariate normality, which is problematic when analysing abundances. 3. We propose Gaussian copula graphical models (GCGMs) for studying the effect of mediator species on co-occurence patterns. GCGMs are a flexible type of graphi-cal model which naturally accommodates all data types, for example binary (pres-ence/absence), counts, as well as ordinal data and biomass, in a unified framework. Simulations demonstrate that GCGMs can be applied to a much broader range of data types than the methods currently used in ecology, and perform as well as or better than existing methods in many settings. 4. We apply GCGMs to counts of hunting spiders, in order to visualise associations between species. We also analyse abundance data of New Zealand native forest cover (on an ordinal scale) to show how GCGMs can be used analyse large and complex datasets. In these data, we were able to reproduce known species relationships as well as generate new ecological hypotheses about species associations.

abstract = {The worldwide leaf economic spectrum (WLES) is a strikingly consistent pattern of correlations among leaf traits. Although the WLES effectively summarizes variation in plant ecological strategies, little is known about its evolution. We reviewed estimates of natural selection and genetic variation for leaf traits to test whether the evolution of the WLES was limited by selection against unfit trait combinations or by genetic constraints. There was significant selection for leaf traits on both ends of the WLES spectrum, as well as significant genetic variation for these traits. In addition, genetic correlations between WLES traits were variable in strength and direction. These data suggest that genetic constraints have had a smaller role than selection in the evolution of the WLES. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Canopy conductance was calculated from transpiration measured in 21 broadleaved and coniferous forest stands, under different climates: temperate, mountain, tropical and boreal. Common features in the dependence of gc on climate and on soil water content were exhibited. When soil water was not limiting, gc was shown to increase linearly with LAI in the range 0 to 6 m2 m-2 and reach a plateau value. Besides the positive effect of increasing R and the negative effect of increasing D on gc, it was surprisingly shown that a decrease in extractable soil water induced a similar reduction in gc in various tree species, equally in coniferous and in broadleaved. Based on these findings, a general canopy conductance function is proposed.},

abstract = {One of the fundamental challenges in ecology is to identify the signature of assembly mechanisms result- ing from patterns of community composition. For this purpose, the trait-based approach has promoted the analysis of functional trait distributions within communities. Until now, much attention has been paid to the design of appropriate null models and the definition of relevant functional metrics for infer- ring community assembly mechanisms from trait distributions. However, less consideration were given to the set of methodological choices preceding the statistical analysis – i.e. from designing a sampling scheme to measuring traits – and how likely they influence the conclusions drawn, as this may subject the analysis to methodological biases. In this regard, a comprehensive perspective on how the overall set of methodological choices influence the inference of community assembly mechanisms is needed. We extensively reviewed recent studies that have addressed animal and plant community assembly by applying a trait-based null model approach. We analyzed how the set of methodological choices in these studies depended on the mechanisms of interest and how they could influence the conclusions drawn by the authors. We found that methodological choices only weakly depended on the hypothesized assembly mechanisms studied by the authors, especially because the two main assembly mechanisms hypothesized, i.e. environmental filtering and limiting similarity, were often tested based on a common experimental design. In contrast, the detection of assembly mechanisms was strongly dependent on the sampling scale, the type of data, the origin of trait values and the delineation of the reference species pool, while less affected by the null model and the functional metrics chosen. These results underline plausible methodological biases in favor of the detection of certain mechanisms to the detriment of others. In addition, there was a significant relationship between the predominant mechanisms concluded by the authors and the type of organism used as biological model, suggesting either that the methodological choices depend on a common strategy used by the different authors when studying similar biological models, or that the methodological choices depended on certain particular properties of the organisms. From this extensive review, we highlight major conceptual and methodological issues that need to be addressed in trait-based null model approaches. We synthesize the methodological choices relevant to study several assembly mechanisms while minimizing methodological biases. We then derive practical guidelines and emphasize the importance of spatial structure in sampling strategy and null model design, because of the scale-dependent signatures of ecological processes.},

abstract = {Understanding the processes maintaining species diversity is a central problem in ecology, with implications for the conservation and management of ecosystems. Although biologists often assume that trait differences between competitors promote diversity, empirical evidence connecting functional traits to the niche differences that stabilize species coexistence is rare. Obtaining such evidence is critical because traits also underlie the average fitness differences driving competitive exclusion, and this complicates efforts to infer community dynamics from phenotypic patterns. We coupled field-parameterized mathematical models of competition between 102 pairs of annual plants with detailed sampling of leaf, seed, root, and whole-plant functional traits to relate phenotypic differences to stabilizing niche and average fitness differences. Single functional traits were often well correlated with average fitness differences between species, indicating that competitive dominance was associated with late phenology, deep rooting, and several other traits. In contrast, single functional traits were poorly correlated with the stabilizing niche differences that promote coexistence. Niche differences could only be described by combinations of traits, corresponding to differentiation between species in multiple ecological dimensions. In addition, several traits were associated with both fitness differences and stabilizing niche differences. These complex relationships between phenotypic differences and the dynamics of competing species argue against the simple use of single functional traits to infer community assembly processes but lay the groundwork for a theoretically justified trait-based community ecology.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Here we report the profound and yet uncertain consequences of the human imprint on the phosphorus cycle and nitrogen:phosphorus stoichiometry for the structure, functioning and diversity of terrestrial and aquatic organisms and ecosystems.

abstract = {Predicting the future of any given species represents an unprecedented challenge in light of the many environmental and biological factors that affect organismal performance and that also interact with drivers of global change. In a three-year experiment set in the Mongolian steppe, we examined the response of the common grass Festuca lenensis to manipulated temperature and water while controlling for topographic variation, plant-plant interactions, and ecotypic differentiation. Plant survival and growth responses to a warmer, drier climate varied within the landscape. Response to simulated increased precipitation occurred only in the absence of neighbors, demonstrating that plant-plant interactions can supersede the effects of climate change. F. lenensis also showed evidence of local adaptation in populations that were only 300 m apart. Individuals from the steep and dry upper slope showed a higher stress/drought tolerance, whereas those from the more productive lower slope showed a higher biomass production and a greater ability to cope with competition. Moreover, the response of this species to increased precipitation was ecotype specific, with water addition benefiting only the least stress-tolerant ecotype from the lower slope origin. This multifaceted approach illustrates the importance of placing climate change experiments within a realistic ecological and evolutionary framework. Existing sources of variation impacting plant performance may buffer or obscure climate change effects. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Intraspecific trait variability (ITV) plays a central part in various ecological pro-cesses, though using mean trait values may be sufficient in some instances. Ecol-ogists need thus to find under which circumstances. Carlucci et al. (2015, this issue) bring new evidence on the importance of ITV for community assembly across a strong gradient. Sampling design may affect ITV quantification across gradients. Over the last years, growing evidence has accumulated on the fundamental role intraspecific trait variability (ITV) plays on ecological and evolutionary processes. Moving beyond the use of mean trait values may improve our understanding of processes acting within and among com-munities (Violle et al. 2012). However, given that (1) eco-logical field work cannot be exhaustive, (2) ITV generally contributes less to trait variance than interspecific differ-ences, and (3) ITV is rarely documented in trait databases, it has become critical to identify those circumstances under which ITV should not be neglected (Albert et al. 2011). Dealing with understory sapling communities across a canopy openness gradient in Brasil, Carlucci et al. (2015) bring new evidence to this debate. We may deplore that only specific leaf area (SLA) was measured, traits being known to be unevenly variable (Albert et al. 2010; Kichenin et al. 2013). However, they nicely explore the partition of variance both irrespective of community com-position and across the gradient, compare the response of the trait mean (CWM) and variance (FD), and compare the effect of ITV within (ITV within) and among (ITV among) communities. In this study, accounting for ITV enhances both mean plant responses and niche partitioning along the gradient. While ITV contributes less to trait variance than interspecific differences, it still disproportionately counts for revealing community patterns that otherwise could be misinterpreted (Jung et al. 2010). This reinforces the view that representing less than half of trait variation is not meaningful enough to serve as the criterion for decid-ing when ignoring ITV is reasonable (Albert et al. 2011). Four of their results are of specific interest. First, Carlucci et al. (2015) found ITV among to be much more important than ITV within for the variation in FD across the gradient. In previous studies a large part of ITV occurred within communities (Albert et al. 2010; Messier et al. 2010). We may thus wonder whether this reduced},

abstract = {Modeling soil water availability for tropical trees is a prerequisite to predicting the future impact of climate change on tropical forests. In this paper we develop a discrete-time deterministic water balance model adapted to tropical rainforest climates, and we validate it on a large dataset that includes micro-meteorological and soil parameters along a topographic gradient in a lowland forest of French Guiana. The model computes daily water fluxes (rainfall interception, drainage, tree transpiration and soil plus understorey evapotranspiration) and soil water content using three input variables: daily precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and solar radiation. A novel statistical approach is employed that uses Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) soil moisture data to estimate water content at permanent wilting point and at field capacity, and root distribution. Inaccuracy of the TDR probes and other sources of uncertainty are taken into account by model calibration through a Bayesian framework. Model daily output includes relative extractable water, REW, i.e. the daily available water standardized by potential available water. The model succeeds in capturing temporal variations in REW regardless of topographic context. The low Root Mean Square Error of Predictions suggests that the model captures the most important drivers of soil water dynamics, i.e. water refilling and root water extraction. Our model thus provides a useful tool to explore the response of tropical forests to climate scenarios of changing rainfall regime and intensity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Recent observations of widespread changes in mature tropical forests such as increasing tree growth, recruitment and mortality rates and increasing above-ground biomass suggest that 'global change' agents may be causing predictable changes in tropical forests. However, consensus over both the robustness of these changes and the environmental drivers that may be causing them is yet to emerge. This paper focuses on the second part of this debate. We review (i) the evidence that the physical, chemical and biological environment that tropical trees grow in has been altered over recent decades across large areas of the tropics, and (ii) the theoretical, experimental and observational evidence regarding the most likely effects of each of these changes on tropical forests. Ten potential widespread drivers of environmental change were identified: temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, climatic extremes (including {\$}El Ni\backslashtilde{\{}n{\}}o-Southern{\$} Oscillation events), atmospheric CO2 concentrations, nutrient deposition, {\$}O{\_}3/acid{\$} depositions, hunting, land-use change and increasing liana numbers. We note that each of these environmental changes is expected to leave a unique 'fingerprint' in tropical forests, as drivers directly force different processes, have different distributions in space and time and may affect some forests more than others (e.g. depending on soil fertility). Thus, in the third part of the paper we present testable a priori predictions of forest responses to assist ecologists in attributing particular changes in forests to particular causes across multiple datasets. Finally, we discuss how these drivers may change in the future and the possible consequences for tropical forests.},

abstract = {Land-use history interacts with natural forces to influence the severity of disturbance events and the rate and nature of recovery processes in tropical forests. Although we are far from an integrated view of forest recovery processes, some generalizations can be made. Recovery of forest structure and composition is relatively rapid following disturbances that primarily impact forest canopies, such as hurricanes. Recovery is considerably slower following disturbances that heavily impact soils as well as aboveground vegetation, such as bulldozing, heavy or long-term grazing, and severe fires, often with long-lasting effects on species composition. The landscape matrix plays a critical role in local recovery processes. Proximity of disturbed areas to remnant forest patches promotes more rapid recovery, which depends heavily on seed dispersal. Recovery of aboveground biomass is constrained by soil fertility and texture across regions as well as across soil types within a region. Restoration of soil fertility may be a prerequisite for forest recovery on sites with severely degraded soils. Despite evidence of rapid forest recovery following large-scale deforestation, many degraded areas of today's tropics will require human assistance to recover forest structure, species composition, and species interactions typical of mature tropical forests.},

Migrating or dispersing offspring elsewhere is likely to decrease an individual's or its offspring's fitness, not to mention the intrinsic costs and risks of dispersal. Gene flow into a population can counteract gene frequency changes because of selection, imposing a limit on local adaptation. In addition, the migrant flow tends to be higher from densely populated to sparsely populated areas. Thus, although the potential for adaptation might be greatest in poor and sparsely populated environments, gene flow will counteract selection more strongly in such populations. Recent papers, both theoretical and empirical, have clarified the important role of migration in evolution, affecting spatial patterns, species ranges and adaptation to the environment; in particular, by emphasizing the crucial interaction between evolutionary and demographic processes.},

By subsampling the larger plots, we evaluated species richness at smaller scales and found that it generally predicted richness in the larger plots quite well. There were exceptions, however. African plots had low diversity in single hectares, but reasonably high diversity in 20 ha. This can be attributed to the high degree of dominance in African plots: a few abundant species occupied a higher proportion of the forest than in other plots. Finally, based on the recent APG phylogeny, we evaluated diversity at higher taxonomic levels, and found that plots that were richest in species were also richer in genera, families, orders, species per genus, and genera per family. High richness at all taxonomic levels in the most diverse forests demonstrates that at least some of the variation in tropical forest diversity is ancient. However, high species-genus ratios in the richest forests also suggest that recent speciation has contributed to the variation in diversity across tropical forests.},

abstract = {Managed forests are important landscape components in tropical regions and may contribute to biodiversity conservation. Yet, managing tropical forests sustainably requires an understanding of ecosystem responses to silvicultural interventions. We investigated how silvicultural intervention intensity affects tree species composition and diversity over 30years in the Brazilian Amazon by comparing them to pre-logging conditions and to an unlogged control. The interventions comprised logging in 1982 and thinning in 1993-1994 and ranged in intensity from 19 to 53{\%} reduction in the original basal area (BA). Trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥5cm were measured on eight occasions in 41 permanent sample plots of 0.25ha each. Silvicultural intervention intensity influenced both tree species composition and its trajectory within 30years. In contrast, tree species diversity was not impaired. High intervention intensities (with BA reduction{\textgreater}6.6m2ha-1) had a substantial influence on the community of trees (DBH≥10cm), which did not show signs of return to pre-logging species composition. The reduction of BA through harvesting damage and thinning had a stronger effect on species composition than logging of mature trees itself. Thus, damage should be kept to a minimal level and strong thinning interventions should be avoided. This may enhance ecosystem recovery and maintenance of biodiversity at other trophic levels. Since current permitted harvesting intensities in the Brazilian Amazon are lower than the lowest intensity examined in our study, legal harvesting practices are unlikely to cause substantial, long-term changes in tree species composition.},

abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is commonly assessed by comparing phenotypes of plants grown under a range of environmental conditions. However, it is well known that many phenotypic traits vary as a function of growth and development, and that growth and development rates themselves are highly plastic. 'Passive plasticity' (variation in a trait as a consequence of environmentally induced variation in growth) is distinguished from 'ontogenetic plasticity' (environmentally induced variation in the ontogenetic trajectory of a trait) and conclusions regarding phenotypic plasticity may differ dramatically if ontogenetic changes in phenotypic expression are not considered. Studies that demonstrate that phenotypic plasticity is not evenly expressed throughout the organism's lifetime, and that there are periods during development when changes in environmental conditions may not elicit plastic responses or may elicit plastic responses that differ from those expressed at other points in development, are reviewed. In conclusion, studies that do not follow phenotypes throughout the entire course of growth and development may greatly over- or underestimate the degree of plasticity, or even the very nature of the plastic response expressed.},

abstract = {Aim: Climate change affects forest functioning not only through direct physiological effects such as modifying photosynthesis and growing season lengths, but also through indirect effects on community composition related to species extinctions and colonizations. Such indirect effects remain poorly explored in comparison with the direct ones. Biodiversity–ecosystem functioning (BEF) studies commonly exam- ine the effects of species loss by eliminating species randomly. However, species extinctions caused by climate change will depend on the species' vulnerability to the new environmental conditions, thus occurring in a specific, non- random order. Here, we evaluated whether successive tree species extinctions, according to their vulner- ability to climate change, impact forest functions differently than random species losses. Location: Eleven temperate forests across a gradient of climatic conditions in central Europe. Methods: We simulated tree community dynamics with a forest succession model to study the impact of species loss on the communities' aboveground biomass, produc- tivity and temporal stability. Tree species were removed from the local pool (1) ran- domly,},

abstract = {Angiosperm leaves manifest a remarkable diversity of shapes that range fromdevelopmental sequences within a shoot and within crown response to microenvironment to variation among species within and between communities and amongorders or families. It is generally assumed that because photosynthetic leaves are critical to plant growth and survival, variation in their shape reflects natural selection operating on function. Several non-mutually exclusive theories have been proposed to explain leaf shape diversity. These include: thermoregulation of leaves especially in arid and hot environments, hydraulic constraints, patterns of leaf expansion in deciduous species, biomechanical constraints, adaptations to avoid herbivory, adaptations to optimise light interception and even that leaf shape variation is a response to selection on flower form. However, the relative importance, or likelihood, of each of these factors is unclear. Here we review the evolutionary context of leaf shape diversification, discuss the proximal mechanisms that generate the diversity in extant systems, and consider the evidence for each the above hypotheses in the context of the functional significance of leaf shape. The synthesis of these broad ranging areas helps to identify points of conceptual convergence for ongoing discussion and integrated directions for future research.},

abstract = {Key message: We review the recent findings on the influence of drought on tree mortality, growth or ecosystem functioning in tropical rainforests. Drought plays a major role in shaping tropical rainforests and the response mechanisms are highly diverse and complex. The numerous gaps identified here require the international scientific community to combine efforts in order to conduct comprehensive studies in tropical rainforests on the three continents. These results are essential to simulate the future of these ecosystems under diverse climate scenarios and to predict the future of the global earth carbon balance. Context: Tropical rainforest ecosystems are characterized by high annual rainfall. Nevertheless, rainfall regularly fluctuates during the year and seasonal soil droughts do occur. Over the past decades, a number of extreme droughts have hit tropical rainforests, not only in Amazonia but also in Asia and Africa. The influence of drought events on tree mortality and growth or on ecosystem functioning (carbon and water fluxes) in tropical rainforest ecosystems has been studied intensively, but the response mechanisms are complex. Aims: Herein, we review the recent findings related to the response of tropical forest ecosystems to seasonal and extreme droughts and the current knowledge about the future of these ecosystems. Results: This review emphasizes the progress made over recent years and the importance of the studies conducted under extreme drought conditions or in through-fall exclusion experiments in understanding the response of these ecosystems. It also points to the great diversity and complexity of the response of tropical rainforest ecosystems to drought. Conclusion: The numerous gaps identified here require the international scientific community to combine efforts in order to conduct comprehensive studies in tropical forest regions. These results are essential to simulate the future of these ecosystems under diverse climate scenarios and to predict the future of the global earth carbon balance.},

abstract = {The paradox of biodiversity involves three elements, (i) mathematical models predict that species must differ in specific ways in order to coexist as stable ecological communities, (ii) such differences are difficult to identify, yet (iii) there is widespread evidence of stability in natural communities. Debate has centred on two views. The first explanation involves tradeoffs along a small number of axes, including 'colonization-competition', resource competition (light, water, nitrogen for plants, including the 'successional niche'), and life history (e.g. high-light growth vs. low-light survival and few large vs. many small seeds). The second view is neutrality, which assumes that species differences do not contribute to dynamics. Clark et al. (2004) presented a third explanation, that coexistence is inherently high dimensional, but still depends on species differences. We demonstrate that neither traditional low-dimensional tradeoffs nor neutrality can resolve the biodiversity paradox, in part by showing that they do not properly interpret stochasticity in statistical and in theoretical models. Unless sample sizes are small, traditional data modelling assures that species will appear different in a few dimensions, but those differences will rarely predict coexistence when parameter estimates are plugged into theoretical models. Contrary to standard interpretations, neutral models do not imply functional equivalence, but rather subsume species differences in stochastic terms. New hierarchical modelling techniques for inference reveal high-dimensional differences among species that can be quantified with random individual and temporal effects (RITES), i.e. process-level variation that results from many causes. We show that this variation is large, and that it stands in for species differences along unobserved dimensions that do contribute to diversity. High dimensional coexistence contrasts with the classical notions of tradeoffs along a few axes, which are often not found in data, and with 'neutral models', which mask, rather than eliminate, tradeoffs in stochastic terms. This mechanism can explain coexistence of species that would not occur with simple, low-dimensional tradeoff scenarios.},

However, these insights are sensitive to the spatial scale of analysis. Here, we use spatially explicit, neighbourhood models of tree growth and survival for 19 tree species, a highly resolved molecular phylogeny and information on eight functional traits to quantify the relative efficacy of functional similarity and shared ancestry in describing the effects of spatial interactions between tree species on demographic rates. We also assess the congruence of these results with observed phylogenetic and functional structure in the neighbourhoods of live and dead trees. We found strong support for models in which the effects of spatial neighbourhood interactions on tree growth and survival were scaled to species-specific mean functional trait values (e.g., wood specific gravity, leaf succulence and maximum height) but not to phylogenetic distance. The weak phylogenetic signal in functional trait data allowed us to independently interpret the static neighbourhood functional and phylogenetic patterns. We observed greater functional trait similarity in the neighbourhoods of live trees relative to those of dead trees suggesting that environmental filtering is the major force structuring this tree community at this scale while competitive interactions play a lesser role.},

abstract = {One of the remarkable aspects of the tremendous biodiversity found in tropical forests is the wide range of evolutionary strategies that have produced this diversity, indicating many paths to diversification. We compare two diverse groups of trees with profoundly different biologies to discover whether these differences are reflected in their genomes. Ficus (Moraceae), with its complex co-evolutionary relationship with obligate pollinating wasps, produces copious tiny seeds that are widely dispersed. Lithocarpus (Fagaceae), with generalized insect pollination, produces large seeds that are poorly dispersed. We hypothesize that these different reproductive biologies and life history strategies should have a profound impact on the basic properties of genomic divergence within each genus. Using shallow whole genome sequencing for six species of Ficus, seven species of Lithocarpus, and three outgroups, we examined overall genomic diversity, how it is shared among the species within each genus, and the fraction of this shared diversity that agrees with the major phylogenetic pattern. A substantially larger fraction of the genome is shared among species of Lithocarpus, a considerable amount of this shared diversity was incongruent with the general background history of the genomes, and each fig species possessed a substantially larger fraction of unique diversity than Lithocarpus.},

1
The rapid growth rates of light-demanding tree species have been attributed in part to their low-density, low-cost stems. We evaluated the influence of light and biomass support costs on growth rates of trees 8–25 cm in diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) among 21 species differing in wood density in two aseasonal rain forests.


*
2
Measurements of crown width, tree height, d.b.h. and wood density ($\rho$) were used to estimate the stem biomass (Ms) of a standard-sized tree (17 m tall and 16 m2 in crown area), i.e. the cost in stem biomass of supporting a given sized crown at a given height.


*
3
The species showed a three-fold range in support cost, which was highly correlated with wood density (Ms ∝ $\rho$0.77, r2 = 0.72 for the log-transformed relationship). This relationship is due to the high interspecific variation in wood density and the fact that the stem diameter of the standard-sized tree increased only slightly with decreasing wood density, i.e. light-wooded species did not compensate for their lighter, weaker wood by substantially increasing stem thickness.


*
4
Mean growth rate per species showed a 10-fold range and increased with the fraction of trees at least partly in gaps (gap fraction), the reciprocal of support cost (1/Ms), and the reciprocal of wood density (1/$\rho$). The relationship between mean growth rate and 1/Ms was particularly strong when one outlier was excluded (r2 = 0.88) and among the Dipterocarpaceae (r2 = 0.89).


*
5
Log(mortality rate), as determined for all trees per species ≥ 1 cm d.b.h., increased linearly with 1/Ms, 1/$\rho$ and gap fraction.


*
6
These results suggest an important role for wood density and support costs in the classic tradeoff between rapid growth and increased risks of damage and death.},

Recent advances in SDMs allow us to potentially forecast anthropogenic effects on patterns of biodiversity at different spatial scales. However, some limitations still preclude the use of SDMs in many theoretical and practical applications. Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in this field, discuss the ecological principles and assumptions underpinning SDMs, and highlight critical limitations and decisions inherent in the construction and evaluation of SDMs. Particular emphasis is given to the use of SDMs for the assessment of climate change impacts and conservation management issues. We suggest new avenues for incorporating species migration, population dynamics, biotic interactions and community ecology into SDMs at multiple spatial scales. Addressing all these issues requires a better integration of SDMs with ecological theory.},

However, biodiversity loss is expected to occur due to climate change with severe impacts to tropical forests. Using data from a ca. 15 year-old tropical planted forest, we construct models based on a bootstrapping procedure to measure growth and mortality among different species richness treatments in response to extreme climate events. In contrast to higher richness mixtures, in one-species plots we find growth is strongly regulated by climate events and we also find increasingly higher mortality during a consecutive four year dry event. Based on these results together with indicators of loss of resilience, we infer an effect of diversity on critical slowing down. Our work generates new methods, concepts, and applications for global change ecology and emphasises the need for research in the area of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning along environmental stress gradients.},

The analysis indicates that the elements of sustainable forest management may offer a suitable framework for assessing forest degradation as well as its causes and impacts. In general, the review of existing definitions shows that many definitions are either very general or their focus is on reduction of productivity, biomass or biodiversity. Definitions that allude to multiple forest benefits may treat forest values in a comprehensive manner, but are more difficult to use for international purposes in a consistent, transparent manner. A particular issue is definition of suitable thresholds for degraded and non-degraded forests especially with regard to the international climate negotiations, the definition of forest may also have to be reconsidered. Treatment of temporal changes in the forest is crucial for definitions of degradation. In order to not classify short-term changes in the forest growing stock which are part of sustainable forest management interventions as degradation, ITTO, CBD and IPCC have defined degradation appropriately incorporating the ‘long-term' aspect, which is lacking in the FRA 2000 definition. However, none of the definitions specify what long term means.},

Linear mixed models (LMMs) are well suited for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) because they account for both population stratification and cryptic relatedness and achieve increased statistical power by jointly modeling all genotyped markers. Additionally, Bayesian LMMs allow for more flexible assumptions about the underlying distribution of genetic effects, and can concurrently estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genetic markers. Using three recently published Bayesian LMMs, Bayes R, BSLMM, and BOLT-LMM, we investigate an existing data set on eye (n = 625) and skin (n = 684) color from Cape Verde, an island nation off West Africa that is home to individuals with a broad range of phenotypic values for eye and skin color due to the mix of West African and European ancestry. We use simulations to demonstrate the utility of Bayesian LMMs for mapping loci and studying the genetic architecture of quantitative traits in admixed populations. The Bayesian LMMs provide evidence for two new pigmentation loci: one for eye color (AHRR) and one for skin color (DDB1).},

abstract = {The relationship between rooting depth and above-ground hydraulic traits can potentially define drought resistance strategies that are important in determining species distribution and coexistence in seasonal tropical forests, and understanding this is important for predicting the effects of future climate change in these ecosystems. We assessed the rooting depth of 12 dominant tree species (representing c. 42{\%} of the forest basal area) in a seasonal Amazon forest using the stable isotope ratios ($\delta$18O and $\delta$2H) of water collected from tree xylem and soils from a range of depths. We took advantage of a major ENSO-related drought in 2015/2016 that caused substantial evaporative isotope enrichment in the soil and revealed water use strategies of each species under extreme conditions. We measured the minimum dry season leaf water potential both in a normal year (2014; $\Psi$non-ENSO) and in an extreme drought year (2015; $\Psi$ENSO). Furthermore, we measured xylem hydraulic traits that indicate water potential thresholds trees tolerate without risking hydraulic failure (P50 and P88). We demonstrate that coexisting trees are largely segregated along a single hydrological niche axis defined by root depth differences, access to light and tolerance of low water potential. These differences in rooting depth were strongly related to tree size; diameter at breast height (DBH) explained 72{\%} of the variation in the $\delta$18Oxylem. Additionally, $\delta$18Oxylem explained 49{\%} of the variation in P50 and 70{\%} of P88, with shallow-rooted species more tolerant of low water potentials, while $\delta$18O of xylem water explained 47{\%} and 77{\%} of the variation of minimum $\Psi$non-ENSO and $\Psi$ENSO. We propose a new formulation to estimate an effective functional rooting depth, i.e. the likely soil depth from which roots can sustain water uptake for physiological functions, using DBH as predictor of root depth at this site. Based on these estimates, we conclude that rooting depth varies systematically across the most abundant families, genera and species at the Tapaj{\'{o}}s forest, and that understorey species in particular are limited to shallow rooting depths. Our results support the theory of hydrological niche segregation and its underlying trade-off related to drought resistance, which also affect the dominance structure of trees in this seasonal eastern Amazon forest. Synthesis. Our results support the theory of hydrological niche segregation and demonstrate its underlying trade-off related to drought resistance (access to deep water vs. tolerance of very low water potentials). We found that the single hydrological axis defining water use traits was strongly related to tree size, and infer that periodic extreme droughts influence community composition and the dominance structure of trees in this seasonal eastern Amazon forest.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The effects of fire on forest structure and composition were studied in a severely fire-impacted landscape in the eastern Amazon. Extensive sampling of area forests was used to compare structure and compositional differences between burned and unburned forest stands. Burned forests were extremely heterogeneous, with substantial variation in forest structure and fire damage recorded over distances of {\textless}50 m. Unburned forest patches occurred within burned areas, but accounted for only six percent of the sample area. Canopy cover, living biomass, and living adult stem densities decreased with increasing fire inrensiry / frequency, and were as low as 10–30 percent of unburned forest values. Even light burns removed {\textgreater}70 percent of the sapling and vine populations. Pioneer abundance increased dramatically with burn intensity, with pioneers dominating the understory in severely damaged areas. Species richness was inversely related to burn severity, but no clear pattern of species selection was observed. Fire appears to be a cyclical event in the study region: {\textless}30 percent of the burned forest sample had been subjected to only one burn. Based on estimated solar radiation intensities, burning substantially increases fire susceptibility of forests. At least 50 percent of the total area of all burned forests is predicted to become flammable within 16 rainless days, as opposed to only 4 percent of the unburned forest. In heavily burned forest subjected to recurrent fires, 95 percent of the area is predicted to become flammable in {\textless}9 rain-free days. As a recurrent disturbance phenomenon, fire shows unparalleled potential to impoverish and alter the forests of the eastern Amazon.

As florestas queimadas eram extremamente heterog{\^{e}}neas, com uma significativa varia{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o na estrutura florestal, e os danos causados pelo fogo foram registrados em intervalos de menos de 50 metres. Trechos de floresta intacta ocorreram entre as {\'{a}}reas queimadas, mas constituiram apenas 6 porcento da {\'{a}}rea amostrada. A cobertura do dossel, a biomassa viva, e as densidades de indiv{\'{i}}duos adultos vivos diminuiram com o aumento da frequ{\^{e}}ncia/intensidade das ocorr{\^{e}}ncias de fogo, chegando a constituir apenas 10 a 30 porcento dos valores relatives {\'{a}}s florestas intactas.

Our procedure is based on an iterative transformation of the distance between points into a measure of closeness. Our measure has the advantage of being independent of an arbitrary cluster shape and allowing adjustment for covariates. The comparison of the observed measure of closeness to a reference point process leads to a hierarchical clustering of spatial points. The selection of the optimal number of clusters is performed using the Gap statistic. Our procedure is illustrated on a spatial distribution of the Dicorynia guianensis species in the French Guiana terra firme rainforest.},

However, with the ever-increasing availability of large-scale biodiversity monitoring data, there is a need for a sound methodology capable of simultaneously accounting for spatial and temporal changes in diversity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Using the properties of Chao's index, we adapted Rao's framework of diversity decomposition between orthogonal dimensions to a multiplicative $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, $\gamma$-decomposition of functional or phylogenetic diversity over space and time, thereby combining their respective properties. We also developed guidelines for interpreting both temporal and spatial $\beta$-diversities and their interaction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* We characterized the range of $\beta$-diversity estimates and their relationship to the nested decomposition of diversity. Using simulations, we empirically demonstrated that temporal and spatial $\beta$-diversities are independent from each other and from $\alpha$- and $\gamma$-diversities when the study design is balanced, but not otherwise. Furthermore, we showed that the interaction term between the temporal and the spatial $\beta$-diversities lacked such properties.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* We illustrated our methodology with a case study of the spatio-temporal dynamics of functional diversity in bird assemblages in four regions of France. Based on these data, our method makes it possible to discriminate between regions experiencing different diversity changes in time. Our methodology may therefore be valuable for comparing diversity changes over space and time using large-scale data sets of repeated surveys.},

abstract = {Lotsy (1925) suggested that hybridizing plant species be grouped into larger interbreeding taxa that he named “syngameons.” Such hybridizing taxa have long been well-documented among plants, but zoologists have traditionally downplayed the role of hybridization in animal evolution. Templeton (1989), however, has recently suggested that mammalian species which freely hybridize should also be grouped into syngameons. A literature survey suggests that the ability of any two mammalian species to hybridize successfully (i.e., produce viable, fertile hybrid offspring) is negatively correlated with time since phylogenetic divergence. In this regard, the genus Homo is a prime candidate for the presence of syngameons since the genus Homo (sensu stricto Wood and Collard, 1999) only emerged ca. 2.0 million years ago. The Late Pleistocene paleospecies Homo neanderthalensis is morphologically quite distinct from H. sapiens. The marked morphological (and genetic) distance between these two members of the genus Homo has led many human paleontologists to infer that these two taxa are separate species. From a current systematic perspective, such a position is justified, since in almost all species concepts species are defined by characters, of which the ability to interbreed is only one. In fact, the ability to interbreed is a plesiomorphic character, and as such we should not be surprised if two sister taxa, such as H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens, retain this ability. There is, however, a relative dearth of paleontological evidence for such interbreeding — a somewhat surprising finding that warrants further exploration.},

abstract = {The Cape Floristic Region ('fynbos biome') has very high levels of plant species diversity and endemism. Much of this diversity is concentrated in a relatively small number of clades centered in the region (Cape clades), and these form a vegetation called 'fynbos'. The general explanation for the origin of this diversity is that much of it evolved in the Pliocene and Late Miocene in response to progressive aridification. We present a phylogenetic analysis of an almost complete species sample of the largest clade of Restionaceae, the third largest Cape clade. This indicates that the radiation of the Restionaceae started between 20 and 42 Myr ago, and since then there were no, or at most gradual, changes in the speciation rate in this clade. For seven other clades, the estimated starting dates for their radiation ranges from 7 to 20 Myr ago. Combining the radiation patterns for these clades shows that ca. 15{\%} of the modern species evolved during the Pleistocene, and almost 40{\%} since the beginning of the Pliocene. We suggest that these clades might have radiated in response to the fynbos vegetation increasing its extent in the Cape as a result of climatic change.},

abstract = {The study of plant species and trait distributions can provide answers to many of the ecological challenges of our times, from climate change to the biodiversity crisis. Although traits are classically measured at the species level, understanding intraspecific variation is necessary to determine the type of response species will have to climate change. Here we measured and analyzed seven leaf traits (leaf area—LA, specific leaf area—SLA, leaf thickness—LT, leaf dry mass content—LDMC, venation density—VD, stomata length—SL, and stomata density—SD) across 14 locally dominant palm species (10 individuals/species) distributed along hydro-topographic gradients (1.4–37 m of terrain height above nearest drainage) of a central Amazonian forest to disentangle the role of species identity, relatedness, and local hydrology on trait variation and covariation. Our results show that trait variation is not always larger between species than within species as expected. Intraspecific variation accounted for 23–74{\%} of trait variation depending on the trait. Most of the variation happened at species level for SL, LA, LT, and SD but not for SLA, VD, and LDMC. For a third of the traits (LDMC, SLA, and SD), we found some evidence of phylogenetic inertia. This lack of independency among traits is confirmed by the maintenance of strong correlation among some of those traits after controlling for local environmental conditions. Intraspecific variation, however, was not related to height above nearest drainage for any of the traits. Most of the trait–environment relationships were species-specific. Therefore, the change in palm trait composition detected along topography, from higher community means of SLA and LA, lower LT, LDMC, SL, and SD in the wet valleys to opposite traits in drier plateaus, is mostly due to the turnover in species composition and relative abundance variation. We conclude these palm species have well-defined hydrological niches, but their large intraspecific variation in leaf traits does not contribute to the adjustment of individuals to the local hydrological conditions in this Amazonian forest.},

Here, we use classical coexistence theory to reframe the debate in terms of stabilizing mechanisms (niches) and fitness equivalence (neutrality). The neutral model is a special case where stabilizing mechanisms are absent and species have equivalent fitness. Instead of asking whether niches or neutral processes structure communities, we advocate determining the degree to which observed diversity reflects strong stabilizing mechanisms overcoming large fitness differences or weak stabilization operating on species of similar fitness. To answer this question, we propose combining data on per capita growth rates with models to: (i) quantify the strength of stabilizing processes; (ii) quantify fitness inequality and compare it with stabilization; and (iii) manipulate frequency dependence in growth to test the consequences of stabilization and fitness equivalence for coexistence.},

abstract = {The maintenance of species boundaries despite interspecific gene flow has been a continuous source of interest in evolutionary biology. Many hybridizing species have porous genomes with regions impermeable to introgression, conferring reproductive barriers between species. We used ecological niche modelling to study the glacial and postglacial recolonization patterns between the widely hybridizing spruce species Picea glauca and P. engelmannii in western North America. Genome-wide estimates of admixture based on a panel of 311 candidate gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from 290 genes were used to assess levels of admixture and introgression and to identify loci putatively involved in adaptive differences or reproductive barriers between species. Our palaeoclimatic modelling suggests that these two closely related species have a long history of hybridization and introgression, dating to at least 21 000 years ago, yet species integrity is maintained by a combination of strong environmental selection and reduced current interspecific gene flow. Twenty loci showed evidence of divergent selection, including six loci that were both Fst outliers and associated with climatic gradients, and fourteen loci that were either outliers or showed associations with climate. These included genes responsible for carbohydrate metabolism, signal transduction and transcription factors. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

We introduce new T-statistics ('T' for trait), based on the comparison of intraspecific and interspecific variances of functional traits across organizational levels, to operationally incorporate intraspecific variability into community ecology theory.

It is often suggested that forests with high biodiversity have large stocks and high rates of carbon uptake. Evidence is, however, scattered across geographic areas and scales, and it remains unclear whether biodiversity is just a co-benefit or also a requirement for the maintenance of carbon stocks and uptake. Here, we perform a quantitative review of empirical studies that analyzed the relationships between plant biodiversity attributes and carbon stocks and carbon uptake in tropical forests. Our results show that biodiversity attributes related to species, traits or structure significantly affect carbon stocks or uptake in 64{\%} of the evaluated relationships. Average vegetation attributes (community-mean traits and structural attributes) are more important for carbon stocks, whereas variability in vegetation attributes (i.e., taxonomic diversity) is important for both carbon stocks and uptake. Thus, different attributes of biodiversity have complementary effects on carbon stocks and uptake. These biodiversity effects tend to be more often significant in mature forests at broad spatial scales than in disturbed forests at local spatial scales. Biodiversity effects are also more often significant when confounding variables are not included in the analyses, highlighting the importance of performing a comprehensive analysis that adequately accounts for environmental drivers. In summary, biodiversity is not only a co-benefit, but also a requirement for short- and long-term maintenance of carbon stocks and enhancement of uptake. Climate change policies should therefore include the maintenance of multiple attributes of biodiversity as an essential requirement to achieve long-term climate change mitigation goals.},

Emissions are then counterbalanced by forest regrowth. With an original modelling approach, calibrated on a network of 133 permanent forest plots (175 ha total) across Amazonia, we link regional differences in climate, soil and initial biomass with survivors' and recruits' C fluxes to provide Amazon-wide predictions of post-logging C recovery. We show that net aboveground C recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield and in the west (21 ±3 Mg C ha-1) than in the south (12 ±3 Mg C ha-1) where environmental stress is high (low rainfall, high seasonality). We highlight the key role of survivors in the forest regrowth and elaborate a comprehensive map of post-disturbance C recovery potential in Amazonia.},

abstract = {Every species on Earth fills a unique environmental niche that is driven, in part, by the process of environmental filtering, where the adaptive value of the functional traits of individuals determine their fitness within the given environmental conditions. Despite its long-standing importance in ecology, theoretical investigations of environmental filtering have lagged behind studies of species interactions and neutral dynamics. A new statistical model of trait-based environmental filtering can be a useful tool for exploring the logical consequences of this process while holding all other processes constant. The model uses the logic of objective Bayesian inference to compute the probabilities of species within different environments using two sources of information: the location and dispersion of species within functional trait space, and the statistical relationship between traits and environmental gradients. By varying key parameters in the model, we highlight several testable hypotheses for trait-based ecology. First, niche breadth decreases as intraspecific trait variation decreases, as the strength of the environmental filter increases, and if the trait values do not enhance fitness in any environmental condition in the landscape. Second, niche shape is determined by the form of the trait-environment relationships, where species with extreme trait values are predicted to dominate at the environmental extremes when traits are linearly related to the environment, species with intermediate trait values generally have a selective advantage across a broader environmental range, and bimodal species response curves can occur independently from negative species interactions. The generality of these modelling results can be tested using empirical data from any ecosystem.},

We evaluated the relative importance of above- versus below-ground competition during the first years of old-field succession on soil with low fertility in Southern Mexico, using the premise that competition for light is size-asymmetric, unlike competition for nutrients. Plant growth is thus expected to be disproportionally impeded by larger neighbors. We studied how growth and survival of 3.5–5.5 m tall saplings of Cecropia peltata and Trichospermum mexicanum , two pioneer species that dominate the secondary forests in the study region, varied with the abundance and size of neighboring trees in 1–2 year old secondary vegetation. We found that local neighborhood basal area varied 10-fold (3 to 30 cm 2 m -2 ) and explained most of the variation in diameter and height growth of the target saplings. Most growth variables were strongly affected by the neighbors bigger than the focal trees with no significant additive effect of the smaller neighbors, indicating asymmetric competition. Smaller neighbors did have a small but significant additive effect on the diameter growth of Cecropia saplings and stem slenderness of Trichospermum saplings. We conclude that competition for light was more important than belowground competition in this initial phase of moist tropical forest successional, despite the low soil fertility.},

abstract = {We investigated the means and timing by which mutations become fixed in the human colonic epithelium by visualizing somatic clones and mathematical inference. Fixation requires two sequential steps. First, one of approximately seven active stem cells residing within each colonic crypt has to be mutated. Second, the mutated stem cell has to replace neighbors to populate the entire crypt in a process that takes several years. Subsequent clonal expansion due to crypt fission is infrequent for neutral mutations (around 0.7{\%} of all crypts undergo fission in a single year). Pro-oncogenic mutations subvert both stem cell replacement to accelerate fixation and clonal expansion by crypt fission to achieve high mutant allele frequencies with age. The benchmarking of these behaviors allows the advantage associated with different gene-specific mutations to be compared irrespective of the cellular mechanisms by which they are conferred. Winton and colleagues describe stem cell dynamics in normal human colon to identify the efficiency of clone fixation within the epithelium and the rate of subsequent lateral expansion. Against these benchmarks biased stem cell behaviors advantaged in both fixation and expansion can be quantified to predict the age-related burden of pro-oncogenic mutation.},

The sun-shade acclimation and plasticity of 16 functional leaf traits of 38 tropical tree species were studied in relation to their light demand, maximum adult stature and ontogenetic changes in crown exposure. 2. Species differed significantly in all leaf traits, which explained a large part of the observed variation (average R-2 = 0.72). Light had a significant effect on 12 traits and species showed a similar proportional response to light, indicating that the species ranking in trait performance is largely maintained in different light environments. 3. Specific leaf area, leaf nutrient content and chlorophyll : nitrogen ratio showed the largest plasticity to irradiance. These traits are important for maximizing growth in different light conditions because they are closely linked to the photosynthetic capacity and carbon balance of the plant. 4. Plasticity is generally thought to be greatest for pioneer species that occupy early successional habitats with a large variation in irradiance. This hypothesis was rejected because short-lived pioneers showed the lowest plasticity to irradiance. 5. An alternative hypothesis states that plasticity is largest for tall species that experience large ontogenetic changes in irradiance during their life cycle. Yet plasticity was barely related to adult stature or ontogenetic changes in crown exposure. Short-lived pioneers that experience consistently high light levels did have low plasticity, but shade-tolerant species that experience consistently low light levels had high plasticity. 6. Tropical rainforest species show a large variation in plasticity. Plasticity is a compromise between many factors and constraints, and all of these may explain the observed patterns to some extent.},

abstract = {Quantitative genetic theory provides a means of estimating the evolutionary potential of natural populations. However, this approach was previously only feasible in systems where the genetic relatedness between individuals could be inferred from pedigrees or experimental crosses. The genomic revolution opened up the possibility of obtaining the realized proportion of genome shared among individuals in natural populations of virtually any species, which could promise (more) accurate estimates of quantitative genetic parameters in virtually any species. Such a ‘genomic' quantitative genetics approach relies on fewer assumptions, offers a greater methodological flexibility, and is thus expected to greatly enhance our understanding of evolution in natural populations, for example, in the context of adaptation to environmental change, eco-evolutionary dynamics, and biodiversity conservation. Information about genetic (co)variances of traits is essential to understand and predict evolutionary change. This has gained additional importance in the light of contemporary human-induced environmental change to which species and populations need to adapt. Quantitative genetics studies genetic (co)variances based on the phenotypic resemblance of related individuals. Relatedness among individuals can be known from observed pedigrees or breeding experiments but such information can only be gathered for a limited range of species. The advances in genomics tools now allow us to genotype virtually any species for thousands of genomic markers. Relatedness estimates from such genomic markers have been used in human genetics as well as animal and plant breeding, but doing so also in wild populations has the potential to considerably advance our understanding of adaptation in the wild.},

abstract = {There is growing interest in using spatially explicit, individual-based forest simulation models to explore the ecological and silvicultural consequences of various harvesting regimes. However, simulating the dynamics of managed forests requires harvesting algorithms capable of accurately mimicking the harvest regimes of interest. Under selection silviculture, trees are harvested individually or in small groups, with the aim of retaining trees across a full range of size classes. An algorithm that reproduces selection harvesting must therefore be able to recreate both the spatial and the structural patterns of harvest. Here we introduce a selection harvest algorithm that simulates harvests as a contagious spatial process in which the cutting of one tree affects the probability that neighboring trees are also cut. Three simple and intuitive parameters are required to implement this process: (1) the probability of cutting a “target” tree (Pt) (often a function of tree size), (2) the probability of cutting its nearest neighbor (Pn), and (3) the total number of target trees to cut (Nt). Specification of these parameters allows representation of both the spatial and the structural patterns of harvest expected under selection silviculture. Based on this simple process, we built two different versions of the harvesting algorithm. An “empirical” algorithm was designed and calibrated to reproduce the observed spatial and size distribution of stumps (harvested trees) at a study site in central Ontario, and was successful in reproducing harvesting patterns found in the field, notably variability in the cluster size of harvested trees. The “user-defined” algorithm implements alternative harvesting regimes (user-defined harvest targets), which may differ in the intensity of harvesting, the size-specificity of harvesting, and the spatial pattern of harvesting. We show that the user-defined harvesting algorithm succeeds in meeting harvest targets specified by the user (e.g., size class distribution and basal area of trees harvested), while simultaneously adjusting the gap size specified (i.e., the distribution of harvested trees per cluster). Incorporation of this harvesting algorithm into spatially explicit, individual-based models will permit analyses of long-term responses of forest stands to harvesting scenarios that more realistically capture the complex patterns of within-stand variability generated by selection silviculture as practiced in actual managed forests.},

abstract = {Studies of spatial variation in the environment have primarily focused on how genetic variation can be maintained. Many one-locus genetic models have addressed this issue, but, for several reasons, these models are not directly applicable to quantitative (polygenic) traits. One reason is that for continuously varying characters, the evolution of the mean phenotype expressed in different environments (the norm of reaction) is also of interest. Our quantitative genetic models describe the evolution of phenotypic response to the environment, also known as phenotypic plasticity (Gause, 1947), and illustrate how the norm of reaction (Schmalhausen, 1949) can be shaped by selection. These models utilize the statistical relationship which exists between genotype-environment interaction and genetic correlation to describe evolution of the mean phenotype under soft and hard selection in coarse-grained environments. Just as genetic correlations among characters within a single environment can constrain the response to simultaneous selection, so can a genetic correlation between states of a character which are expressed in two environments. Unless the genetic correlation across environments is ± 1, polygenic variation is exhausted, or there is a cost to plasticity, panmictic populations under a bivariate fitness function will eventually attain the optimum mean phenotype for a given character in each environment. However, very high positive or negative correlations can substantially slow the rate of evolution and may produce temporary maladaptation in one environment before the optimum joint phenotype is finally attained. Evolutionary trajectories under hard and soft selection can differ: in hard selection, the environments with the highest initial mean fitness contribute most individuals to the mating pool. In both hard and soft selection, evolution toward the optimum in a rare environment is much slower than it is in a common one. A subdivided population model reveals that migration restriction can facilitate local adaptation. However, unless there is no migration or one of the special cases discussed for panmictic populations holds, no geographical variation in the norm of reaction will be maintained at equilibrium. Implications of these results for the interpretation of spatial patterns of phenotypic variation in natural populations are discussed.},

abstract = {Climate modelling studies predict that the rain forests of the Eastern Amazon basin are likely to experience reductions in rainfall of up to 50{\%} over the next 50-100 years. Efforts to predict the effects of changing climate, especially drought stress, on forest gas exchange are currently limited by uncertainty about the mechanism that controls stomatal closure in response to low soil moisture. At a through-fall exclusion experiment in Eastern Amazonia where water was experimentally excluded from the soil, we tested the hypothesis that plants are isohydric, that is, when water is scarce, the stomata act to prevent leaf water potential from dropping below a critical threshold level. We made diurnal measurements of leaf water potential ($\Psi$l), stomatal conductance (gs), sap flow and stem water potential ($\Psi$stem) in the wet and dry seasons. We compared the data with the predictions of the soil-plant-atmosphere (SPA) model, which embeds the isohydric hypothesis within its stomatal conductance algorithm. The model inputs for meteorology, leaf area index (LAI), soil water potential and soil-to-leaf hydraulic resistance (R) were altered between seasons in accordance with measured values. No optimization parameters were used to adjust the model. This 'mechanistic' model of stomatal function was able to explain the individual tree-level seasonal changes in water relations (r2 = 0.85, 0.90 and 0.58 for $\Psi$l, sap flow and gs, respectively). The model indicated that the measured increase in R was the dominant cause of restricted water use during the dry season, resulting in a modelled restriction of sap flow four times greater than that caused by reduced soil water potential. Higher resistance during the dry season resulted from an increase in below-ground resistance (including root and soil-to-root resistance) to water flow. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {In this study, six highly polymorphic microsatellite loci and a categorical paternity analysis approach were used to investigate the contemporary pollen gene flow in the neotropical tree species Symphonia globulifera. Data for this study were taken from a 500 ha experimental plot in a dense terra firme forest in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon and included the mapping and genotyping of 161 reproductive trees, representing more than 90{\%} of all adult trees, and the collection of 748 open-pollinated seeds from 56 seed-trees over two field seasons (2002 and 2003). High levels of pollen immigration from outside of the study plot were detected in both sampled seed-years (≥49{\%}) suggesting long distance pollen gene flow. Low levels of self-fertilization were also detected (≤2{\%}). The analysis showed long distance pollen dispersal occurred within the study area in both 2002 ($\delta$ = 907 ± 652 m SD) and 2003 ($\delta$ = 963 ± 542 m SD). Patterns of pollen dispersal distance within the plot were also found to be shorter than the distances between potential male parents and seed-trees. This result indicates that the distance between trees does not explain the identified pollen dispersal pattern. Our results support the hypothesis that animal pollinated species occurring in low-density populations can disperse pollen in long distances, despite the very dense nature of the forest. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Simulations have traditionally been used in population genetics by a fairly small community with programming expertise, but the recent availability of dozens of sophisticated, customizable software packages for simulation now makes simulation an accessible option for researchers in many fields. The in silico genetic data produced by simulations, along with greater availability of population-genomics data, are transforming genetic epidemiology, anthropology, evolutionary and population genetics and conservation. In this Review of the state-of-the-art of simulation software, we identify applications of simulations, evaluate simulator capabilities, provide a guide for their use and summarize future directions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Tree diversity could mitigate this impact, but unambiguous demonstration of the diversity-resistance relationship is lacking in semi-natural mature forests. We used a network of 208 forest plots sampled along two orthogonal gradients of increasing tree species richness and latitudes to assess total tree defoliation in Europe. We found a positive relationship between tree species richness and resistance to insect herbivores: overall damage to broadleaved species significantly decreased with the number of tree species in mature forests. This pattern of associational resistance was frequently observed across tree species and countries, irrespective of their climate. These findings confirm the greater potential of mixed forests to face future biotic disturbances in a changing world.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This paper introduces molecular ecological models in which pollination and seed dispersal primarily occur among nearby trees according to some decreasing functions of interdistances. The models are based on inhomogeneous Poisson processes and applicable to mapped data of genotyped adults and offspring. Parameters in the process can be optimized by the maximum likelihood method. If the optimized model satisfactorily fits given data, seed dispersal and pollen flow are quantitatively assessed under specific function forms. If not, the degree of the unfitting expresses the degree of the influence of some other factors such as unequal female reproductive success, seed movement by animals and selection, and the inhomogeneous Poisson process can be extended to include such factors. The methodology is demonstrated for a Fagus crenata population. The inhomogeneous Poisson process model can be used for checking the relevance of the function forms used in previous theoretical studies of isolation-by-distance as well as for a basic null assumption that a given population is formed only by limited pollen and seed dispersal. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

We characterize the variant allele fractions (VAFs) of somatic single nucleotide variants and indels across 5095 clinical samples profiled using a custom panel, CancerSCAN. Our results demonstrate that a significant fraction of clinically actionable variants have low VAFs, often due to low tumor purity and treatment-induced mutations. The percentages of mutations under 5{\%} VAF across hotspots in EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF are 16{\%}, 11{\%}, 12{\%}, and 10{\%}, respectively, with 24{\%} for EGFR T790M and 17{\%} for PIK3CA E545. For clinical relevance, we describe two patients for whom targeted therapy achieved remission despite low VAF mutations. We also characterize the read depths necessary to achieve sensitivity and specificity comparable to current laboratory assays. These results show that capturing low VAF mutations at hotspots by sufficient sequencing coverage and carefully tuned algorithms is imperative for a clinical assay.},

abstract = {The MaxEnt software package is one of the most popular tools for species distribution and environmental niche modeling, with over 1000 published applications since 2006. Its popularity is likely for two reasons: 1) MaxEnt typically outperforms other methods based on predictive accuracy and 2) the software is particularly easy to use. MaxEnt users must make a number of decisions about how they should select their input data and choose from a wide variety of settings in the software package to build models from these data. The underlying basis for making these decisions is unclear in many studies, and default settings are apparently chosen, even though alternative settings are often more appropriate. In this paper, we provide a detailed explanation of how MaxEnt works and a prospectus on modeling options to enable users to make informed decisions when preparing data, choosing settings and interpreting output. We explain how the choice of background samples reflects prior assumptions, how nonlinear functions of environmental variables (features) are created and selected, how to account for environmentally biased sampling, the interpretation of the various types of model output and the challenges for model evaluation. We demonstrate MaxEnt's calculations using both simplified simulated data and occurrence data from South Africa on species of the flowering plant family Proteaceae. Throughout, we show how MaxEnt's outputs vary in response to different settings to highlight the need for making biologically motivated modeling decisions.},

abstract = {Polyploidy has played an important role in evolution across the tree of life but it is still unclear how polyploid lineages may persist after their initial formation. While both common and well-studied in plants, polyploidy is rare in animals and generally less well- understood. The Australian burrowing frog genus Neobatrachus is comprised of six diploid and three polyploid species and offers a powerful animal polyploid model system. We generated exome-capture sequence data from 87 individuals representing all nine species of Neobatrachus to investigate species-level relationships, the origin and inheritance mode of polyploid species, and the population genomic effects of polyploidy on genus-wide demography. We resolve the phylogenetic relationships among Neobatrachus species and provide further support that the three polyploid species have independent autotetraploid origins. We document higher genetic diversity in tetraploids, resulting from widespread gene flow specifically between the tetraploids, asymmetric inter-ploidy gene flow directed from sympatric diploids to tetraploids, and current isolation of diploid species from each other. We also constructed models of ecologically suitable areas for each species to investigate the impact of climate variation on frogs with differing ploidy levels. These models suggest substantial change in suitable areas compared to past climate, which in turn corresponds to population genomic estimates of demographic histories. We propose that Neobatrachus diploids may be suffering the early genomic impacts of climate-induced habitat loss, while tetraploids appear to be avoiding this fate, possibly due to widespread gene flow into tetraploid lineages specifically. Finally, we demonstrate that Neobatrachus is an attractive model to study the effects of ploidy on the evolution of adaptation in animals.},

abstract = {The leaf model of C3 photosynthesis of Farquhar, von Caemmerer {\&} Berry (Planta 149, 78–90, 1980) provides the basis for scaling carbon exchange from leaf to canopy and Earth-System models, and is widely used to project biosphere responses to global change. This scaling requires using the leaf model over a wider temperature range than that for which the model was originally parameterized. The leaf model assumes that photosynthetic CO2 uptake within a leaf is either limited by the rate of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration or the activity of RuBP carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco). Previously we reported a re-parameterization of the temperature responses of Rubisco activity that proved robust when applied to a range of species. Herein this is extended to re-parameterizing the response of RuBP-limited photosynthesis to temperature. RuBP-limited photosynthesis is assumed to depend on the whole chain electron transport rate, which is described as a three-parameter non-rectangular hyperbolic function of photon flux. Herein these three parameters are determined from simultaneous measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence and CO2 exchange of tobacco leaves, at temperatures from 10 to 40 °C. All varied significantly with temperature and were modified further with variation in growth temperature from 15 to 35 °C. These parameters closely predicted the response of RuBP-limited photosynthesis to temperature measured in both lemon and poplar and showed a significant improvement over predictions based on earlier parameterizations. We provide the necessary equations for use of the model of Farquhar et al. (1980) with our newly derived temperature functions for predicting both Rubisco- and RuBP-limited photosynthesis.},

The data repository currently contains almost three million trait entries for 69 000 out of the world's 300 000 plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of traits characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence. A first data analysis shows that most plant traits are approximately log-normally distributed, with widely differing ranges of variation across traits. Most trait variation is between species (interspecific), but significant intraspecific variation is also documented, up to 40{\%} of the overall variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly used in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the observed variation – but for several traits most variation occurs within PFTs, up to 75{\%} of the overall variation. In the context of vegetation models these traits would better be represented by state variables rather than fixed parameter values. The improved availability of plant trait data in the unified global database is expected to support a paradigm shift from species to trait-based ecology, offer new opportunities for synthetic plant trait research and enable a more realistic and empirically grounded representation of terrestrial vegetation in Earth system models.},

abstract = {In angiosperms, many studies have described the inter-specific variability of In hydraulic-related traits and little is known at the intra-specific level. This information is however mandatory to assess the adaptive capacities of tree populations in the context of increasing drought frequency and severity. Ten 20-year old European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) provenances representing the entire distribution range throughout Europe and differing significantly in aboveground biomass increment (ABI) by a factor of up to four were investigated for branch wood anatomical, hydraulic, and foliar traits in a provenance trial located in Northern Europe. We quantified to which extend xylem hydraulic and leaf traits are under genetic control and tested whether the xylem hydraulic properties (hydraulic efficiency and safety) trades off with yield and wood anatomical and leaf traits. Our results showed that only three out of 22 investigated ecophysiological traits showed significant genetic differentiations between provenances, namely vessel density (VD), the xylem pressure causing 88{\%} loss of hydraulic conductance and mean leaf size. Depending of the ecophysiological traits measured, genetic differentiation between populations explained 0-14{\%} of total phenotypic variation, while intra-population variability was higher than inter-population variability. Most wood anatomical traits and some foliar traits were additionally related to the climate of provenance origin. The lumen to sapwood area ratio, vessel diameter, theoretical specific conductivity and theoretical leaf-specific conductivity as well as the C:N-ratio increased with climatic aridity at the place of origin while the carbon isotope signature ($\delta$13C) decreased. Contrary to our assumption, none of the wood anatomical traits were related to embolism resistance but were strong determinants of hydraulic efficiency. Although ABI was associated with both VD and $\delta$ 13 C, both hydraulic efficiency and embolism resistance were unrelated, disproving the assumed trade-off between hydraulic efficiency and safety. European beech seems to compensate increasing water stress with growing size mainly by Hydraulics Properties of Beech Provenances adjusting vessel number and not vessel diameter. In conclusion, European beech has a high potential capacity to cope with climate change due to the high degree of intra-population genetic variability.},

In this review, we take a plant perspective centred on four lines of evidence: (i) introgression, (ii) selection, (iii) phenotype and (iv) fitness. While advances in genomics have contributed to our understanding of introgression and porous species boundaries (task 1), and the detection of signatures of selection in introgression (task 2), the investigation of adaptive introgression critically requires links to phenotypic variation and fitness (tasks 3 and 4). We also discuss the conservation implications of adaptive introgression in the face of climate change.

abstract = {SUMMARY 1. Methods used for the study of species—environment relationships can be grouped into: (i) simple indirect and direct gradient analysis and multivariate direct gradient analysis (e.g. canonical correspondence analysis), all of which search for non-symmetric patterns between environmental data sets and species data sets; and (ii) analysis of juxtaposed tables, canonical correlation analysis, and intertable ordination, which examine spedes—environment relationships by considering each data set equally. Different analytical techniques are appropriate for fulfilling different objectives. 2. We propose a method, co-inertia analysis, that can synthesize various approaches encountered in the ecological literature. Co-inertia analysis is based on the mathematically coherent Euclidean model and can be universally reproduced (i.e. independently of software) because of its numerical stability. The method performs simultaneous analysis of two tables. The optimizing criterion in co-inertia analysis is that the resulting sample scores (environmental scores and faunistic scores) are the most covariant. Such analysis is particularly suitable for the simultaneous detection of faunistic and environmental features in studies of ecosystem structure. 3. The method was demonstrated using faunistic and environmental data from Friday (Freshzvater Biology 18, 87—104, 1987). In this example, non-symmetric analyses is inappropriate because of the large number of variables (species and environmental variables) compared with the small number of samples. 4. Co-inertia analysis is an extension of the analysis of cross tables previously attempted by others. It serves as a general method to relate any kinds of data set, using any kinds of standard analysis (e.g. principal components analysis, correspondence analysis, multiple correspondence analysis) or between-class and within-class analyses.},

abstract = {Global environmental changes strongly impact wild and domesticated species biology and their associated ecosystem services. For crops, global warming has led to significant changes in terms of phenology and/or yield. To respond to the agricultural challenges of this century, there is a strong need for harnessing the genetic variability of crops and adapting them to new conditions. Gene flow, from either the same species or a different species, may be an immediate primary source to widen genetic diversity and adaptions to various environments. When the incorporation of a foreign variant leads to an increase of the fitness of the recipient pool, it is referred to as “adaptive introgression”. Crop species are excellent case studies of this phenomenon since their genetic variability has been considerably reduced over space and time but most of them continue exchanging genetic material with their wild relatives. In this paper, we review studies of adaptive introgression, presenting methodological approaches and challenges to detecting it. We pay particular attention to the potential of this evolutionary mechanism for the adaptation of crops. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of farmers' knowledge and practices in shaping wild-to-crop gene flow. Finally, we argue that screening the wild introgression already existing in the cultivated gene pool may be an effective strategy for uncovering wild diversity relevant for crop adaptation to current environmental changes and for informing new breeding directions.},

- You need to show 1) introgrssion (both foreign origin and persistence) and 2) adaptive value by identifying selection footprint and/or fitness effects
- Numeruos methods and metrics, neither are perfects, multiple evidences are the best
- Challenge to detect introgression lay on distinguishing introgression and ancestral shared polymorhisms (incomplete lineage sorting), especially for recent divergences
- fD (Martin et al. 2015) can be applied on small genomics regions to detect introgression
- Inference of selection can be difficult as adaptive introgression can lead to different patterns than traditional hard sweep
- inference of selection only give indirect evidence
- adaptive introgression should be ultimately validated by fitness advantage (linked to markers function with phenotype-genotype associations)},

abstract = {Natural systems harbor complex interactions that are fundamental parts of ecology and evolution. These interactions challenge our inclinations and training to seek the simplest explanations of patterns in nature. Not least is the likelihood that some complex processes might be missed when their patterns look similar to predictions for simpler mechanisms. Along these lines, theory and empirical evidence increasingly suggest that environmental, ecological, phenotypic, and genetic processes can be tightly intertwined, resulting in complex and sometimes surprising eco-evolutionary dynamics. The goal of this review is to temper inclinations to unquestioningly seek the simplest explanations in ecology and evolution, by recognizing that some eco-evolutionary outcomes may appear very similar to purely ecological, purely evolutionary, or even null expectations, and thus be cryptic. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for observational biases and mechanisms that might operate among the various links in eco-evolutionary feedbacks to produce cryptic patterns. Recognition that cryptic dynamics can be associated with outcomes like stability, resilience, recovery, or coexistence in a dynamically changing world provides added impetus for finding ways to study them.},

abstract = {1. The goal of conservation and restoration activities is to maintain biological diversity and the ecosystem services that this diversity provides. These activities traditionally focus on the measures of species diversity that include only information on the presence and abundance of species. Yet how diversity influences ecosystem function depends on the traits and niches filled by species. 2. Biological diversity can be quantified in ways that account for functional and phenotypic differences. A number of such measures of functional diversity (FD) have been created, quantifying the distribution of traits in a community or the relative magnitude of species similarities and differences. We review FD measures and why they are intuitively useful for understanding ecological patterns and are important for management. 3. In order for FD to be meaningful and worth measuring, it must be correlated with ecosystem function, and it should provide information above and beyond what species richness or diversity can explain. We review these two propositions, examining whether the strength of the correlation between FD and species richness varies across differing environmental gradients and whether FD offers greater explanatory power of ecosystem function than species richness. 4. Previous research shows that the relationship between FD and richness is complex and context dependent. Different functional traits can show individual responses to different gradients, meaning that important changes in diversity can occur with minimal change in richness. Further, FD can explain variation in ecosystem function even when richness does not. 5. Synthesis and applications. FD measures those aspects of diversity that potentially affect community assembly and function. Given this explanatory power, FD should be incorporated into conservation and restoration decision-making, especially for those efforts attempting to reconstruct or preserve healthy, functioning ecosystems.},

Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes.

abstract = {The causes of the species richness of tropical trees are poorly understood, in particular the roles of ecological factors such as soil composition. The nickel(Ni)-hyperaccumulating tree genus Geissois (Cunoniaceae) from the South-west Pacific was chosen as a model of diversification on different substrates. Here, we investigated the leaf element compositions, spatial distributions and phylogeny of all species of Geissois occurring on New Caledonia. We found that New Caledonian Geissois descended from a single colonist and diversified relatively quickly into 13 species. Species on ultramafic and nonultramafic substrates showed contrasting patterns of leaf element composition and range overlap. Those on nonultramafic substrates were largely sympatric but had distinct leaf element compositions. By contrast, species on ultramafic substrates showed similar leaf element composition, but occurred in many cases exclusively in allopatry. Further, earlier work showed that at least three out of these seven species use different molecules to bind Ni. Geissois qualifies as a cryptic adaptive radiation, and may be the first such example in a lineage of tropical forest trees.

abstract = {Local tree species distributions in tropical forests correlate strongly with soil water availability. However, it is unclear how species distributions are shaped by demographic responses to soil water availability. Specifically, it remains unknown how growth affects species distributions along water availability gradients relative to mortality. We quantified spatial variation in dry season soil water potential (SWP) in the moist tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and used a hierarchical Bayesian approach to evaluate relationships between demographic responses of naturally regenerating seedlings to SWP (RGRs and first-year mortality) and species distributions along the SWP gradient for 62 species. We also tested whether species that were more abundant at the wet or dry end of the gradient performed better (a) at their “home end” of the gradient (“best at home” hypothesis) and (b) “at home” compared to co-occurring species (“home advantage” hypothesis). Four and five species responded significantly to SWP in terms of growth or mortality respectively. Growth (but not mortality) responses were positively related to species distributions along the SWP gradient; species with a more positive (negative) growth response to SWP were more abundant at higher (lower) SWP, that is, at wetter (drier) sites. In addition, wet distributed species grew faster on the wet end of the SWP gradient than on the dry end (“best at home”) and grew faster on the wet end than dry distributed species (“home advantage”). Mortality rates declined with seedling size for all species. Thus, seedling growth responses to SWP indirectly shaped local species distributions by influencing seedling size and thereby mortality risk. Synthesis. By demonstrating how growth responses to spatial variation in soil water availability affect species distributions, we identified a demographic process underlying niche differentiation on hydrological gradients in tropical forests. Recognizing the role of these growth responses in shaping species distributions should improve the understanding of tropical forest composition and diversity along rainfall gradients and with climate change.},

abstract = {$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Ecologists use approaches based on plant functional traits to tackle several fundamental and applied questions. Although a perfect characterization of functional trait structure requires the measurement of all the individuals in communities, this is prohibitively resource-consuming. Consequently, the general practice is to average the trait values of a reduced number of individuals per species. However, there are different alternatives regarding the number, identity and spatial location of the individuals chosen to calculate species-averaged trait values.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* In this study, we compared different strategies for sampling functional traits, using community-weighted mean trait values (CWM) and the Rao index of functional diversity (FD). We intensively sampled the functional trait structure along a topographical gradient in a Mediterranean grassland, obtaining accurate estimations of the ‘real' values of these indices (CWMI and FDI) for three traits (height, leaf area and specific leaf area).$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* We simulated three different sampling strategies differing in the spatial location of the individuals used to estimate species-mean trait: (i) average of the whole gradient (GLO), (ii) average of the sampling unit in which the abundances of species maximize (MAX) and (iii) average of a reduced number of individuals per species and sampling unit (LOC). For each strategy, we simulated different sampling intensities (number of individuals sampled).$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* For each trait, we examined the ability of each strategy and sampling intensity to accurately estimate CWMI and FDI, as well as their ability to detect changes in functional trait structure along the topographical gradient.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* LOC outperformed the other strategies in terms of accuracy and bias, and was much more efficient to describe changes along the gradient, regardless of the traits and indicators considered. Furthermore, LOC was the only strategy that improved consistently as sampling intensity increased, especially at low levels of intensity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Our results indicate that the impact of considering intraspecific variability in trait values can be greater than commonly assumed. Strategies that neglect this source of variability can result in inaccurate or biased estimations of the functional trait structure of plant communities. Most importantly, we show that intraspecific variability can be taken into consideration without any increases in the total number of individuals measured.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n},

abstract = {A considerable extent of interspecific hybridization among dominant canopy dipterocarp species was recently found in a tropical rain forest fragment in Singapore. However, information about the fertility of the hybrids and the growth of their successive hybrids remains limited. We studied the flowering phenology of four dipterocarp species in the genus Shorea (S. curtisii, S. leprosula, S. parvifolia, and S. macroptera) and two hybrids (S. curtisii × S. leprosula and S. leprosula × S. parvifolia) and studied the performances of seedlings reproduced from them. We observed that S. macroptera bloomed first, without overlap with congeneric species, followed by the other Shorea species and the two first filial (F1) hybrids. S. curtisii and S. leprosula, the species forming hybrids are most likely to succeed in this forest, completely overlapped with their hybrids. Fruits collected from the hybrids were viable, and these hybrid seedlings showed greater survival and a higher growth rate than those from pure species under greenhouse conditions. They included various cross types such as a backcross with each parent species. These results may imply that successive hybrids and introgression spontaneously occur among Shorea species. It may be important to consider the risk of hybridization for the management of tropical forests, particularly in degraded tropical rainforests where mechanisms of ecological isolation between closely related species might be altered.},

abstract = {Data on hundreds or thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) provide detailed information about the relationships between individuals, but currently few tools can turn this information into a multigenerational pedigree. I present the r package sequoia, which assigns parents, clusters half-siblings sharing an unsampled parent and assigns grandparents to half-sibships. Assignments are made after consideration of the likelihoods of all possible first-, second- and third-degree relationships between the focal individuals, as well as the traditional alternative of being unrelated. This careful exploration of the local likelihood surface is implemented in a fast, heuristic hill-climbing algorithm. Distinction between the various categories of second-degree relatives is possible when likelihoods are calculated conditional on at least one parent of each focal individual. Performance was tested on simulated data sets with realistic genotyping error rate and missingness, based on three different large pedigrees (N = 1000–2000). This included a complex pedigree with overlapping generations, occasional close inbreeding and some unknown birth years. Parentage assignment was highly accurate down to about 100 independent SNPs (error rate {\textless}0.1{\%}) and fast ({\textless}1 min) as most pairs can be excluded from being parent–offspring based on opposite homozygosity. For full pedigree reconstruction, 40{\%} of parents were assumed nongenotyped. Reconstruction resulted in low error rates ({\textless}0.3{\%}), high assignment rates ({\textgreater}99{\%}) in limited computation time (typically {\textless}1 h) when at least 200 independent SNPs were used. In three empirical data sets, relatedness estimated from the inferred pedigree was strongly correlated to genomic relatedness.},

abstract = {Despite widespread focus on interspecific variation in trait-based ecology, there is growing evidence that intraspecific trait variability can play a fundamental role in plant community responses to environmental change and community assembly. Here, we quantify the strength and direction of inter- and intraspecific plant community trait responses along a 900 m elevation gradient spanning alpine and subalpine plant communities in southern New Zealand. We measured five commonly used leaf traits (i.e. dry matter content, N and P concentrations, leaf area and specific leaf area) on all 31 dominant and subordinate species recorded along the gradient, and examined their species-specific and community-level responses to elevation using both abundance-weighted and nonweighted averages of trait values. By decomposing the variance of community-level measures of these traits across the gradient, we showed that the contribution of interspecific variation to the response of plant assemblages to elevation was stronger than that of intraspecific variation, for all traits except specific leaf area. Further, the relative contributions of interspecific effects were greater when abundance-weighted rather than nonweighted measures were used. We also observed contrasting intraspecific trait responses to the gradient among species (particularly for leaf N and P concentrations), and found both positive and negative covariation between inter- and intraspecific effects on community-level trait values. The weak community-average trait responses to elevation, as found for specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf N and P concentrations, resulted from strong but opposing responses among vs. within species, which are not typically accounted for in species-based measures of plant community responses. For instance, increasing elevation (and associated factors such as a decrease in soil nutrient availability) favoured the dominance of species with relatively high leaf nutrient concentrations while simultaneously triggering an intraspecific decrease in the leaf nutrient concentrations of these species. The context dependency of positive and negative covariation between inter- and intraspecific trait variability, and the species-specific nature of intraspecific shifts in functional trait values, reveal highly complex plastic responses of plants to environmental changes, and highlights the need for greater consideration of the role that intraspecific variation plays in community-level processes. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

A few instances of resistance to phytophagous insects owing to somatic mutations have been reported in the literature. More recently, a striking example has demonstrated how somatic mutations confer resistance to an herbicide on an invasive plant, Hydrilla verticillata. The array of new methods for manipulating genomes (e.g., gene-editing) plus existing examples of somatic mutation-associated resistance suggest that such mutations might be useful in silviculture, agriculture, and horticulture. Answering several general questions about somatic mutations in plants would facilitate such applications: Why are so few examples reported?

Methods: Bird censuses were undertaken using point counts at each site and compared with landscape metrics and habitat characteristics of reserves. Results: Forest cover within reserves, zoochoric species richness, tree and shrub species richness, and tree height were associated with resident, forest and fruit-eating bird species richness in tropical dry forests.

abstract = {Future intensification of Amazon drought resulting from climate change may cause increased fire activity, tree mortality, and emis-sions of carbon to the atmosphere across large areas of Amazonia. To provide a basis for addressing these issues, we examine properties of recent and future meteorological droughts in the Amazon in 35 climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). We find that the CMIP5 climate models, as a group, simulate important properties of historical meteorological droughts in the Amazon. In addition, this group of models reprod-uces observed relationships between Amazon precipitation and regional sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Pacific and the North Atlantic oceans. Assuming the Representative Con-centration Pathway 8.5 scenario for future drivers of climate change, the models project increases in the frequency and geographic extent of meteorological drought in the eastern Amazon, and the opposite in the West. For the region as a whole, the CMIP5 models suggest that the area affected by mild and severe meteorological drought will nearly double and triple, respectively, by 2100. Extremes of wetness are also projected to increase after 2040. Specifically, the frequency of periods of unusual wetness and the area affected by unusual wet-ness are projected to increase after 2040 in the Amazon as a whole, including in locations where annual mean precipitation is projected to decrease. Our analyses suggest that continued emissions of green-house gases will increase the likelihood of extreme events that have been shown to alter and degrade Amazonian forests. Amazon Basin | climate | precipitation extremes | CMIP5 | drought T he responses of tropical forests to severe droughts exert strong influences on the global carbon cycle (1, 2). During periods of extended soil water stress, changes in forest physiology and structure reduce the capacity of forests to cycle and store carbon (3–5). In the 2000s, for example, more than half of the Amazon experienced droughts that were severe enough to cause increased tree mortality and reduced tree growth (6). In response to these droughts, 1–2{\%} of the carbon stocks of Amazonian for-ests were committed to the atmosphere (6, 7), while large amounts were combusted due to widespread fires. Although similar droughts have occurred for millennia (8), and forests have ap-parently recovered from such events (9), climate change could intensify hydrological extremes over the basin (10). Together with warmer climatic conditions, an increase in the frequency and severity of droughts could push the Amazon region into a new climate envelope (11), potentially releasing to the atmo-sphere a large part of the 120 Pg of carbon stored in these forests (12). These effects on the carbon stocks of the Amazon could be even more pronounced if forest fires become more common in the region. There is disagreement about the potential responses of Amazon forests to climate change (13). Earlier versions of climate−vege-tation models projected that as climate changed, many forests growing in southeast Amazonia would be replaced by savanna-like ecosystems within the next 50–100 y (14). This shift in vegetation dominance would result mostly from warm and dry climatic con-ditions (15). However, other projections are less grim. Instead of widespread changes in vegetation states, some models project that increases in air temperature are likely to cause losses in forest carbon stocks but also that increased atmospheric CO 2 concen-tration would promote forest growth and associated carbon ac-cumulation (16). The net result of these two opposing forces appears in some studies to be approximately neutral, although positive vegetation responses to high CO 2 concentration remain poorly understood (17). Interestingly, assessments of the potential future trajectories of Amazonian forests using dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) driven by global climate models (e.g., ref. 16) show smaller effects than are seen in field observations and experi-ments. Field-based studies suggest that severe hydrological droughts tend to reduce both forest growth rates (via reduced photosynthesis) and carbon stocks (via increased tree mortality) (18). At least two factors account for the relatively small effects of hydrological droughts seen in simulations. First, most eco-system models lack a mechanism to represent short-term carbon losses resulting from severe drought events (4). Powell et al. (19), for instance, showed that commonly used DGVMs were unable to represent the spike in drought-induced tree mortality observed in two large-scale throughfall exclusion experiments conducted in east Amazonia. Based on these results, the authors argued that DGVMs must strive to improve vegetation responses (e.g., mor-tality) to extreme, relatively short-term weather events. The second explanation relates to the ability of climate models to represent basic drought conditions. Climate model results drive ecosystem models and provide insights into processes that exert strong influences on the structural dynamics of tropical forests (e.g., drought-induced tree mortality and forest fires). Although several studies have demonstrated a strong associa-tion between historical droughts and anomalies in sea surface},

abstract = {*
The leaf economics spectrum (LES) provides a useful framework for examining species strategies as shaped by their evolutionary history. However, that spectrum, as originally described, involved only two key resources (carbon and nutrients) and one of three economically important plant organs. Herein, I evaluate whether the economics spectrum idea can be broadly extended to water – the third key resource –stems, roots and entire plants and to individual, community and ecosystem scales. My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade-off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources.



*
Evidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients. These apply generally within and across scales (within and across communities, climate zones, biomes and lineages).



*
There are linkages across organs and coupling among resources, resulting in an integrated whole-plant economics spectrum. Species capable of moving water rapidly have low tissue density, short tissue life span and high rates of resource acquisition and flux at organ and individual scales. The reverse is true for species with the slow strategy. Different traits may be important in different conditions, but as being fast in one respect generally requires being fast in others, being fast or slow is a general feature of species.



*
Economic traits influence performance and fitness consistent with trait-based theory about underlying adaptive mechanisms. Traits help explain differences in growth and survival across resource gradients and thus help explain the distribution of species and the assembly of communities across light, water and nutrient gradients. Traits scale up – fast traits are associated with faster rates of ecosystem processes such as decomposition or primary productivity, and slow traits with slow process rates.



*
Synthesis. Traits matter. A single ‘fast–slow' plant economics spectrum that integrates across leaves, stems and roots is a key feature of the plant universe and helps to explain individual ecological strategies, community assembly processes and the functioning of ecosystems.},

abstract = {Genomewide association mapping in model organisms such as inbred mouse strains is a promising approach for the identification of risk factors related to human diseases. However, genetic association studies in inbred model organisms are confronted by the problem of complex population structure among strains. This induces inflated false positive rates, which cannot be corrected using standard approaches applied in human association studies such as genomic control or structured association. Recent studies demonstrated that mixed models successfully correct for the genetic relatedness in association mapping in maize and Arabidopsis panel data sets. However, the currently available mixed-model methods suffer from computational inefficiency. In this article, we propose a new method, efficient mixed-model association (EMMA), which corrects for population structure and genetic relatedness in model organism association mapping. Our method takes advantage of the specific nature of the optimization problem in applying mixed models for association mapping, which allows us to substantially increase the computational speed and reliability of the results. We applied EMMA to in silico whole-genome association mapping of inbred mouse strains involving hundreds of thousands of SNPs, in addition to Arabidopsis and maize data sets. We also performed extensive simulation studies to estimate the statistical power of EMMA under various SNP effects, varying degrees of population structure, and differing numbers of multiple measurements per strain. Despite the limited power of inbred mouse association mapping due to the limited number of available inbred strains, we are able to identify significantly associated SNPs, which fall into known QTL or genes identified through previous studies while avoiding an inflation of false positives. An R package implementation and webserver of our EMMA method are publicly available. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Genetics Society of America.},

However, to identify effective forest management strategies, there is a need for methods supporting the decision-making process. The main objective of our study is to analyze the mid- and long-term impacts of different management intensities, such as varying the minimum stem diameter of harvestable commercial trees, on the dynamic and structure of a species-rich tropical lowland forest of French Guiana. Therefore, we have applied the management module of a dynamic forest model and analyzed simulation experiments for undisturbed forest growth and selective logging. For the first time we were able to quantify the mean recovery times of multiple ecosystem functions and properties (biomass, gross primary production, leaf area index, Shanon diversity, timber volume) after selective logging. Accordingly, we validated simulation results (biomass, number of trees harvested) of selective logging with forest inventory data from the last 32 years. The forest model reliably reproduces the observed pre-logging biomass, tree-size distribution, and logging intensity (10 trees/ha, 39 m3/ha). In addition, it became clear how strongly management with higher logging intensities influences the forest in the long term: (1) the mean recovery times of the investigated ecosystem functions were significantly extended. With very intensive logging (116 m3/ha), the average recovery time of forest biomass was almost twice as long as in a moderate simulation scenario (tint 138 a, tmod 77 a). Similar patterns were observed for other ecosystem functions, e.g. timber volume (tint 158 a, tmod 62 a). (2) Additionally, the functional composition shifted, as up to 30{\%} pioneer tree species in particular invaded the forest. This innovative use of forest growth models may help in the development of ecologically reasonable forest management strategies.},

abstract = {THE striking changes that occur in both experimental mixed cultures and in natural populations have, as Dr. Woodruff has reminded us, been observed for °a long time. In attempting a modern ('lxplanation of such changes it is first desirable to call attention to certain controlled lab- oratory experiments, that will provide a key to tlie more complex situation in nature. These experiments are due to Gause and are doubtless generally" familiar; they are explicable by a relatively complete mathematical theory, lIrovided by Lotka (1925), by Volterra (.1926), and by Gause himself (1934,1935). The particular experiments which are fundamental from the standpoint of the present contribution show that: (1) If two species live in an identical niche, competing for the same food supply, maintained at a constant level, one species will entirely displace the other. This has been demonstrated with Paramecium aurelia and Glaucoma scirdillans; the latter, having the higher coefficient of multiplication, alone remains. (2) Dominance in competition is dependent on the en- vironment conditions. This is strikingly shown in experi- ments with mixed cultures of P. aurelia and P. ca'ttdatum, in cultures that have, or have not, received biologically conditioned medium. If metabolic products of Para- mecium, Bacill{\~{}}(,s pyocyaneus, etc., are not added, cau- datum starts growing faster ; if such products have been added, the reverse is true. In general, if the ecological conditions are such that utilization of food is the con- trolling fact{\~{}}i', caudatum is dominant, if resistance to metabolic products, either hetero- or homotypical, is the controlling factor, aurelia is dominant (Gause, Nastukova and Alpatov, 1934). 406},

abstract = {1. Although there is ample support for positive species richness–productivity relationships in planted grassland experiments, a recent 48-site study found no diversity–productivity relationship (DPR) in herbaceous communities. Thus, debate persists about diversity effects in natural versus planted systems. Additionally, current knowledge is weak regarding the influence of evenness on theDPRs, howDPRs are affected by the variation in life-history traitsamong constituent species in polycultures and how DPRs differ among biomes. The impacts of these factors on DPRs in forest ecosystems are evenmore poorly understood. 2. We performed a meta-analysis of 54 studies to reconcile DPRs in forest ecosystems. We quanti- fied the net diversity effect as log effect size [ln(ES)], the log ratio of the productivity in polycultures to the average of those in monocultures within the same type of mixture, site condition and stand age of each study. The first use of a boosted regression treemodel in meta-analysis, a useful method to partition the effects of multiple predictors rather than relying on vote-counting of individual studies, unveiled the relative influences of individual predictors. 3. Global average ln(ES) was 0.2128, indicating 23.7{\%} higher productivity in polycultures than monocultures. The final model explained 21{\%}of the variation in ln(ES). The predictors that sub- stantially accounted for the explained variation included evenness (34{\%}), heterogeneity of shade tolerance (29{\%}), richness (13{\%}) and stand age (15{\%}). In contrast, heterogeneity of nitrogen fixa- tion and growth habits, biome and stand origin (naturally established versus planted) contributed negligibly (each {\pounds}4{\%}). Log effect size strongly increased with evenness from0.6 to 1 and with rich- ness from 2 to 6. Furthermore, it was higher with heterogeneity of shade tolerance and generally increasedwith stand age. 4. Synthesis. Our analysis is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate the critical role of species evenness, richness and the importance of contrasting traits in defining net diversity effects in forest polycultures. While testing the specific mechanisms is beyond the scope of our analysis, our results should motivate future studies to link richness, evenness, contrasting traits and life-history stage to the mechanisms that are expected to produce positive net biodiversity effects such as niche differen- tiation, facilitation and reduced Janzen–Connell effects.},

abstract = {Plants and their herbivores constitute more than half of the organisms in tropical forests. Therefore, a better understanding of the evolution of plant defenses against their herbivores may be central for our understanding of tropical biodiversity. Here, we address the evolution of antiherbivore defenses and their possible contribution to coexistence in the Neotropical tree genus Inga (Fabaceae). Inga has {\textgreater}300 species, has radiated recently, and is frequently one of the most diverse and abundant genera at a given site. For 37 species from Panama and Peru we characterized developmental, ant, and chemical defenses against herbivores. We found extensive variation in defenses, but little evidence of phylogenetic signal. Furthermore, in a multivariate analysis, developmental, ant, and chemical defenses varied independently (were orthogonal) and appear to have evolved independently of each other. Our results are consistent with strong selection for divergent defensive traits, presumably mediated by herbivores. In an analysis of community assembly, we found that Inga species co-occurring as neighbors are more different in antiherbivore defenses than random, suggesting that possessing a rare defense phenotype increases fitness. These results imply that interactions with herbivores may be an important axis of niche differentiation that permits the coexistence of many species of Inga within a single site. Interactions between plants and their herbivores likely play a key role in the generation and maintenance of the conspicuously high plant diversity in the tropics.},

abstract = {Whilst high-resolution spatial variables contribute to a good fit of spatially explicit deforestation models, socio-economic processes are often beyond the scope of these models. Such a low level of interest in the socio-economic dimension of deforestation limits the relevancy of these models for decision-making and may be the cause of their failure to accurately predict observed deforestation trends in the medium term. This study aims to propose a flexible methodology for taking into account multiple drivers of deforestation in tropical forested areas, where the intensity of deforestation is explicitly predicted based on socio-economic variables. By coupling a model of deforestation location based on spatial environmental variables with several sub-models of deforestation intensity based on socio-economic variables, we were able to create a map of predicted deforestation over the period 2001–2014 in French Guiana. This map was compared to a reference map for accuracy assessment, not only at the pixel scale but also over cells ranging from 1 to approximately 600 sq. km. Highly significant relationships were explicitly established between deforestation intensity and several socio-economic variables: population growth, the amount of agricultural subsidies, gold and wood production. Such a precise characterization of socio-economic processes allows to avoid overestimation biases in high deforestation areas, suggesting a better integration of socio-economic processes in the models. Whilst considering deforestation as a purely geographical process contributes to the creation of conservative models unable to effectively assess changes in the socio-economic and political contexts influencing deforestation trends, this explicit characterization of the socio-economic dimension of deforestation is critical for the creation of deforestation scenarios in REDD+ projects.},

abstract = {Most existing forests are subjected to natural and human-mediated selection pressures, which have increased due to climate change and the increasing needs of human societies for wood, fibre and fuel resources. It remains largely unknown how these pressures trigger evolutionary changes. We address this issue here for temperate European oaks (Quercus petraea and Q. robur), which grow in mixed stands, under even-aged management regimes. We screened numerous functional traits for univariate selection gradients and for expected and observed genetic changes over two successive generations. In both species, growth, leaf morphology and physiology, and defence-related traits displayed significant selection gradients and predicted shifts, whereas phenology, water metabolism, structure and resilience-related traits did not. However, the direction of the selection response and the potential for adaptive evolution differed between the two species. Quercus petraea had a much larger phenotypic and genetic variance of fitness than Q. robur. This difference raises concerns about the adaptive response of Q. robur to contemporary selection pressures. Our investigations suggest that Q. robur will probably decline steadily, particularly in mixed stands with Q. petraea, consistent with the contrasting demographic dynamics of the two species.},

abstract = {We investigated the influence of age on survival and breeding rates in a long-lived species Rissa tridactyla using models with individual random effects permitting variation and covariation in fitness components among individuals. Differences in survival or breeding probabilities among individuals are substantial, and there was positive covariation between survival and breeding probability; birds that were more likely to survive were also more likely to breed, given that they survived. The pattern of age-related variation in these rates detected at the individual level differed from that observed at the population level. Our results provided confirmation of what has been suggested by other investigators: within-cohort phenotypic selection can mask senescence. Although this phenomenon has been extensively studied in humans and captive animals, conclusive evidence of the discrepancy between population-level and individual-level patterns of age-related variation in life-history traits is extremely rare in wild animal populations. Evolutionary studies of the influence of age on life-history traits should use approaches differentiating population level from the genuine influence of age: only the latter is relevant to theories of life-history evolution. The development of models permitting access to individual variation in fitness is a promising advance for the study of senescence and evolutionary processes.},

abstract = {The textbook view that most germline mutations in mammals arise from replication errors is indirectly supported by the fact that there are both more mutations and more cell divisions in the male than in the female germline. When analyzing large de novo mutation datasets in humans, we find multiple lines of evidence that call that view into question. Notably, despite the drastic increase in the ratio of male to female germ cell divisions after the onset of spermatogenesis, even young fathers contribute three times more mutations than young mothers, and this ratio barely increases with parental age. This surprising finding points to a substantial contribution of damage-induced mutations. Indeed, C-to-G transversions and CpG transitions, which together constitute over one-fourth of all base substitution mutations, show genomic distributions and sex-specific age dependencies indicative of double-strand break repair and methylation-associated damage, respectively. Moreover, we find evidence that maternal age at conception influences the mutation rate both because of the accumulation of damage in oocytes and potentially through an influence on the number of postzygotic mutations in the embryo. These findings reveal underappreciated roles of DNA damage and maternal age in the genesis of human germline mutations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In wild plant populations, genetic divergence within continuous stands is common, sometimes at very short geographical scales. While restrictions to gene flow combined with local inbreeding and genetic drift may cause neutral differentiation among subpopulations, microgeographical variations in environmental conditions can drive adaptive divergence through natural selection at some targeted loci. Such phenomena have recurrently been observed in plant populations occurring across sharp environmental boundaries, but the interplay between selective processes and neutral genetic divergence has seldom been studied. METHODS: We assessed the extent of within-stand neutral and environmentally-driven divergence in the Neotropical tree Eperua falcate Aubl. (Fabaceae) through a genome-scan approach. Populations of this species grow in dense stands that cross the boundaries between starkly contrasting habitats. Within-stand phenotypic and candidate-gene divergence have already been proven, making this species a suitable model for the study of genome-wide microgeographic divergence. Thirty trees from each of two habitats (seasonally flooded swamps and well-drained plateaus) in two separate populations were genotyped using thousands of AFLPs markers. To avoid genotyping errors and increase marker reliability, each sample was genotyped twice and submitted to a rigorous procedure for data cleaning, which resulted in 1196 reliable and reproducible markers. RESULTS: Despite the short spatial distances, we detected within-populations genetic divergence, probably caused by neutral processes, such as restrictions in gene flow. Moreover, habitat-structured subpopulations belonging to otherwise continuous stands also diverge in relation to environmental variability and habitat patchiness: we detected convincing evidence of divergent selection at the genome-wide level and for a fraction of the analyzed loci (comprised between 0.25{\%} and 1.6{\%}). Simulations showed that the levels of differentiation for these outliers are compatible with scenarios of strong divergent selection.},

abstract = {Warmer and drier climates over Amazonia have been predicted for the next century with expected changes in regional water and carbon cycles. We examined the impact of interannual and seasonal variations in climate conditions on ecosystem-level evapotranspiration (ET) and water use efficiency (WUE) to determine key climatic drivers and anticipate the response of these ecosystems to climate change. We used daily climate and eddyflux data recorded at the Guyaflux site in French Guiana from 2004 to 2014. ET and WUE exhibited weak interannual variability. The main climatic driver of ET and WUE was global radiation (Rg), but relative extractable water (REW) and soil temperature (Ts) did also contribute. At the seasonal scale, ET and WUE showed a modal pattern driven by Rg, with maximum values for ET in July and August and for WUE at the beginning of the year. By removing radiation effects during water depleted periods, we showed that soil water stress strongly reduced ET. In contrast, drought conditions enhanced radiation-normalized WUE in almost all the years, suggesting that the lack of soil water had a more severe effect on ecosystem evapotranspiration than on photosynthesis. Our results are of major concern for tropical ecosystem modeling because they suggest that under future climate conditions, tropical forest ecosystems will be able to simultaneously adjust CO2 and H2O fluxes. Yet, for tropical forests under future conditions, the direction of change in WUE at the ecosystem scale is hard to predict, since the impact of radiation on WUE is counterbalanced by adjustments to soil water limitations. Developing mechanistic models that fully integrate the processes associated with CO2 and H2O flux control should help researchers understand and simulate future functional adjustments in these ecosystems.},

A quantitative model with additive effects was used to link genotypes to phenotypes. No physical linkage was introduced. Using an analytical approach, we compared the diversity within deme (H(S)) and the differentiation (F(ST)) at the QTL with the genetic variance within deme (V(W)) and the differentiation (Q(ST)) for the trait. The difference between F(ST) and Q(ST) was shown to depend on the relative amounts of covariance between QTL within and between demes. Simulations were used to study the effect of selection intensity, variance of optima among demes, and migration rate for an allogamous and predominantly selfing species. Contrasting dynamics of the genetic variability at markers, QTL, and trait were observed as a function of the level of gene flow and diversifying selection. The highest discrepancy among the three levels occurred under highly diversifying selection and high gene flow. Furthermore, diversifying selection might cause substantial heterogeneity among QTL, only a few of them showing allelic differentiation, while the others behave as neutral markers.},

abstract = {The ability to explain why multispecies assemblages produce greater biomass compared to monocultures, has been a central goal in the quest to understand biodiversity effects on ecosystem function. Species contributions to ecosystem function can be driven by two processes: niche complementarity and a selection effect that is influenced by fitness (competitive) differences, and both can be approximated with measures of species' traits. It has been hypothesised that fitness differences are associated with few, singular traits while complementarity requires multidimensional trait measures. Here, using experimental data from plant assemblages, I show that the selection effect was strongest when trait dissimilarity was low, while complementarity was greatest with high trait dissimilarity. Selection effects were best explained by a single trait, plant height. Complementarity was correlated with dissimilarity across multiple traits, representing above and below ground processes. By identifying the relevant traits linked to ecosystem function, we obtain the ability to predict combinations of species that will maximise ecosystem function.},

abstract = {A central question of community ecology is to understand how the interplay between processes of the Neutral Theory (e.g., immigration and ecological drift) and niche-based processes (e.g., environmental filtering, intra- and interspecific density dependence) shape species diversity in competitive communities. The articulation between these two categories of mechanisms can be studied through the lens of the intermediate organizational level of “functional groups” (FGs), defined as clusters of species with similar traits. Indeed, FGs stress ecological differences among species and are thus likely to unravel non-neutral interactions within communities. Here we presented a novel approach to explore how FGs affect species coexistence by comparing species and functional diversity patterns. Our framework considers the Neutral Theory as a mechanistic null hypothesis. It assesses how much the functional diversity deviates from species diversity in communities, and compares this deviation, called the “average functional deviation,” to a neutral baseline. We showed that the average functional deviation can indicate reduced negative density dependence or environmental filtering among FGs. We validated our framework using simulations illustrating the two situations. We further analyzed tropical tree communities in Western Ghats, India. Our analysis of the average functional deviation revealed environmental filtering between deciduous and evergreen FGs along a broad rainfall gradient. By contrast, we did not find clear evidence for reduced density dependence among FGs. We predict that applying our approach to new case studies where environmental gradients are milder and FGs are more clearly associated to resource partitioning should reveal the missing pattern of reduced density dependence among FGs.},

abstract = {Motivation: Testing for correlations between different sets of genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research. However, searching for overlaps between features with existing webbased methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner. Results: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.

abstract = {Motivation: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been widely used to map loci contributing to variation in complex traits and risk of diseases in humans. Accurate specification of familial relationships is crucial for family-based GWAS, as well as in population-based GWAS with unknown (or unrecognized) family structure. The family structure in a GWAS should be routinely investigated using the SNP data prior to the analysis of population structure or phenotype. Existing algorithms for relationship inference have a major weakness of estimating allele frequencies at each SNP from the entire sample, under a strong assumption of homogeneous population structure. This assumption is often untenable. Results: Here, we present a rapid algorithm for relationship inference using high-throughput genotype data typical of GWAS that allows the presence of unknown population substructure. The relationship of any pair of individuals can be precisely inferred by robust estimation of their kinship coefficient, independent of sample composition or population structure (sample invariance). We present simulation experiments to demonstrate that the algorithm has sufficient power to provide reliable inference on millions of unrelated pairs and thousands of relative pairs (up to 3rd-degree relationships). Application of our robust algorithm to HapMap and GWAS datasets demonstrates that it performs properly even under extreme population stratification, while algorithms assuming a homogeneous population give systematically biased results. Our extremely efficient implementation performs relationship inference on millions of pairs of individuals in a matter of minutes, dozens of times faster than the most efficient existing algorithm known to us. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010.

abstract = {In the tropics, seasonally flooded forests (SFF) harbor fewer tree species than terra firme (i.e. non-flooded) forests. The low species diversity of tropical flooded forests has been ascribed to the paucity of species with adaptations to tolerate flooding. To test the hypothesis that flooding is the only factor restricting most species from SFF, we compared plant morphological and physiological responses to flooding in 2-month old seedlings of 6 species common to SFF and 12 species common to terra firme forests. Although flooding impaired growth, total biomass, maximum root length and stomatal conductance in most species, responses varied greatly and were species-specific. For example, after 90 days, flooding reduced leaf area growth by 10-50{\%} in all species, except in Tabebuia, a common species from non-flooded habitats. Similarly, flooding had a 5-45{\%} negative effect on total biomass for all species, except in 1 SFF and 1 terra firme species both of which had more biomass under flooding. A principal component analysis, using the above responses to flooding, provided no evidence that SFF and terra firme species differed in their responses to flooding. Flooding also caused reductions in root growth for most species. Rooting depth and root: shoot ratios were significantly less affected by flooding in SFF than in terra firme species. Although flood tolerance is critical for survival in flooded habitats, we hypothesize that responses to post-flooding events such as drought might be equally important in seasonal habitats. Therefore, we suggest that the ability to grow roots under anoxia might be critical in predicting success in inundated habitats that also experience a strong dry season.},

abstract = {The theory of reinforcement predicts that natural selection against the production of unfit hybrids favours traits that increase assortative mating. Whether culturally inherited traits, such as bird song, can increase assortative mating by reinforcement is largely unknown. We compared songs of pied (Ficedula hypoleuca) and collared flycatchers (F. albicollis) from two hybrid zones of different ages with songs from allopatric populations. Previously, a character divergence in male plumage traits has been shown to reinforce premating isolation in sympatric flycatchers. In contrast, we find that the song of the pied flycatcher has converged towards that of the collared flycatcher (mixed singing). However, a corresponding divergence in the collared flycatcher shows that the species differences in song characters are maintained in sympatry. Genetic analyses suggest that mixed song is not caused by introgression from the collared flycatcher, but rather due to heterospecific copying. Circumstantial evidence suggests that mixed song may increase the rate of maladaptive hybridization. In the oldest hybrid zone where reinforcement on plumage traits is most pronounced, the frequency of mixed singing and hybridization is also lowest. Thus, we suggest that reinforcement has reduced the frequency of mixed singing in the pied flycatcher and caused a divergence in the song of the collared flycatcher. Whether a culturally inherited trait promotes or opposes speciation in sympatry may depend on its plasticity. The degree of plasticity may be genetically determined and accordingly under selection by reinforcement.},

abstract = {Plant populations can undergo very localized adaptation, allowing widely distributed populations to adapt to divergent habitats in spite of recurrent gene flow. Neotropical trees—whose large and undisturbed populations often span a variety of environmental conditions and local habitats—are particularly good models to study this process. Here, we explore patterns of adaptive divergence from large (i.e., regional) to small (i.e., microgeographic) spatial scales in the hyperdominant Amazonian tree Eperua falcata Aubl. (Fabaceae) under a replicated design involving two microhabitats ({\~{}}300 m apart) in two study sites ({\~{}}300 km apart). A three-year reciprocal transplant illustrates that, beyond strong maternal effects and phenotypic plasticity, genetically driven divergence in seedling growth and leaf traits was detected both between seedlings originating from different regions, and between seedlings from different microhabitats. In parallel, a complementary genome scan for selection was carried out through whole-genome sequencing of tree population pools. A set of 290 divergence outlier SNPs was detected at the regional scale (between study sites), while 185 SNPs located in the vicinity of 106 protein-coding genes were detected as replicated outliers between microhabitats within regions. Outlier-surrounding genomic regions are involved in a variety of physiological processes, including plant responses to stress (e.g., oxidative stress, hypoxia and metal toxicity) and biotic interactions. Together with evidence of microgeographic divergence in functional traits, the discovery of genomic candidates for microgeographic adaptive divergence represents a promising advance in our understanding of local adaptation, which probably operates across multiple spatial scales and underpins divergence and diversification in Neotropical trees.},

abstract = {Organisms can often adapt surprisingly quickly to evolutionary challenges, such as the application of pesticides or antibiotics, suggesting an abundant supply of adaptive genetic variation. In these situations, adaptation should commonly produce 'soft' selective sweeps, where multiple adaptive alleles sweep through the population at the same time, either because the alleles were already present as standing genetic variation or arose independently by recurrent de novo mutations. Most well-known examples of rapid molecular adaptation indeed show signatures of such soft selective sweeps. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms that produce soft sweeps and the approaches used for their identification in population genomic data. We argue that soft sweeps might be the dominant mode of adaptation in many species. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Andean uplift and the collision of North and South America are thought to have major implications for the diversification of the Neotropical biota. However, few studies have investigated how these geological events may have influenced diversification. We present a multilocus phylogeny of 102 Protieae taxa (73{\%} of published species), sampled pantropically, to test hypotheses about the relative importance of dispersal, vicariance, habitat specialization, and biotic factors in the diversification of this ecologically dominant tribe of Neotropical trees. Bayesian fossil-calibrated analyses date the Protieae stem at 55 Mya. Biogeographic analyses reconstruct an initial late Oligocene/early Miocene radiation in Amazonia for Neotropical Protieae, with several subsequent late Miocene dispersal events to Central America, the Caribbean, Brazil's Atlantic Forest, and the Choc{\'{o}}. Regional phylogenetic structure results indicate frequent dispersal among regions throughout the Miocene and many instances of more recent regional in situ speciation. Habitat specialization to white sand or flooded soils was common, especially in Amazonia. There was one significant increase in diversification rate coincident with colonization of the Neotropics, followed by a gradual decrease consistent with models of diversity-dependent cladogenesis. Dispersal, biotic interactions, and habitat specialization are thus hypothesized to be the most important processes underlying the diversification of the Protieae.},

abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The complex geological and climatic history of the Neotropics has had major implications on the diversification of plant lineages. Chrysobalanaceae is a pantropical family of trees and shrubs with 75{\%} of its 531 species found in the Neotropics, and a time-calibrated phylogeny of this family should shed light on the tempo of diversification in the Neotropical flora. Previously published phylogenetic hypotheses of this family were poorly supported, and its biogeography remains unclear.METHODS: We assembled the complete plastid genome of 51 Chrysobalanaceae species, and increased taxon sampling by Sanger-sequencing of five plastid regions for an additional 88 species. We generated a time-calibrated tree including all 139 Chrsyobalanaceae species and 23 outgroups. We then conducted an ancestral area reconstruction analysis and estimated diversification rates in the family.KEY RESULTS: The tree generated with the plastid genome alignment was almost fully resolved. It supports the polyphyly of Licania and Hirtella. The family has diversified starting around the Eocene-Oligocene transition. An ancestral area reconstruction confirms a Paleotropical origin for Chrysobalanaceae with several transoceanic dispersal events. The main Neotropical clade likely resulted from a single migration event from Africa around 28 mya ago, which subsequently underwent rapid diversification.CONCLUSIONS: Given the diverse ecologies exhibited by extant species, we hypothesize that the rapid diversification of Chrysobalanaceae following the colonization of the Neotropics was triggered by habitat specialization during the complex geological and paleoclimatic history of the Neotropics. },

abstract = {We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1 km2). We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15{\%} (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

The rainfall data relate to the south-west monsoon season June to September (122 days), which accounts for the major part of the annual rainfall over most parts of the country. For each of the stations the rain-days are arranged in ascending order of rain amount, and the association between the cumulated percentage rain amount (x) and the cumulated percentage number of rain-days (y), designated as the normalized rainfall curve (NRC), is calculated. It has been shown in an earlier study that x and y are related by the equation x = y exp [— b(100—y)c], where b and c are empirical constants that depend on the coefficient of variation (CV) of the rainfall series. This equation has been utilized to study various parameters of the daily rainfall distribution. The coefficient of variation of the daily rainfall series varies between 100 per cent and 230 per cent at individual stations, with nearly half the number of stations having CV values in the range 130–150 per cent. The number of days of significant rainfall (days with rainfall greater than the mean intensity per rain-day) constitute about 30 per cent of the total number of rain-days and account for about 75 per cent of the seasonal rainfall at almost all the stations.},

In this paper, Ripley's univariate L(r) and bivariate L12(r) functions were used to analyze spatial distribution patterns and spatial associations across different life stages of 131 tree species in a 20-ha plot of a tropical rainforest in Xishuangbanna, southwest China. Our results show that: (1) Saplings of 109 (83.2{\%}) species have a significant clumped distribution, which confirms the ubiquity of clumped spatial distributions among tropical tree species. (2) Adults of 126 (96.2{\%}) species have a random distribution suggesting that density-dependent mortality can make the spatial pattern of tropical trees more regular with time. (3) At small scales (0-10 m), 95 (72.5{\%}) species have a neutral or negative sapling-adult association, implying that there is recruitment limitation within the vicinity of their conspecific adults. The reduction in spatial clumping in going from younger to older life stages and the neutral or negative sapling-adult association imply density-dependent mortality in the vicinity of adult trees. In accordance with the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, such density-dependent mortality can free up space for other species to colonize, contributing to the maintenance of species diversity. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Ecological Society of Japan.},

abstract = {Waterlogging stress is one of the most important abiotic stresses limiting sorghum growth and development. Consequently, the responses of sorghum to waterlogging must be monitored and studied. This study investigated changes in the leaf water status, xylem exudation rate, leaf anatomical structure, leaf temperature and photosynthetic performance. Waterlogging-tolerant (Jinuoliang 01, abbreviated JN01) and waterlogging-sensitive (Jinza 31, abbreviated JZ31) sorghum cultivars were planted in pots. The experiment was carried out using a split block design with three replications. Waterlogging stress was imposed at the sorghum five-leaf stage. The leaf free water content (FWC) and relative water content (RWC) decreased under the waterlogged condition. The leaf thickness was thinner under the waterlogged condition, and the main changes occurred in the upper epidermal and mesophyll cells. Gas exchange parameters and the xylem exudation rate were also restrained by waterlogging; however, greater responses of these parameters were observed in JZ31. JZ31 had a higher leaf-air temperature difference ($\Delta$T) than JN01. We found that changes in $\Delta$T were always consistent with changes in the RWC and the gas exchange parameters. $\Delta$T was significantly associated with the leaf RWC, photosynthetic rate (Pn) and transpiration rate (Tr). The results suggest that $\Delta$T may be an indicator reflecting the water status in leaves and can be used to evaluate the tolerance of sorghum to waterlogging.},

abstract = {Recent research has documented the importance of edaphic factors in determining the habitat associations of tree species in many tropical rain forests, but the underlying mechanisms for edaphic associations are unclear. At Sepilok Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, two main soil types derived from sandstone (ridges) and alluvium (valleys) differ in nutrient and water availability and are characterized by forests differing markedly in species composition, structure, and understory light availability. We use both survey and reciprocal transplants to examine physiological adaptations to differences in light, nutrient, and water availability between these soil types, and test for the importance of resource-use efficiency in determining edaphic specialization. Photosynthetic surveys for congeneric and confamilial pairs (one species per soil type) of edaphic specialists and for generalists common to both soil types show that species specializing on sandstone-derived soil had lower stomatal conductance at a given assimilation rate than those occurring on alluvial soil and also had greater instantaneous and integrated water-use efficiencies. Foliar dark respiration rates per unit photosynthesis were higher for sandstone ridge than alluvial lowland specialists. We suggest that these higher respiration rates are likely due to increases in photosynthetic enzyme concentrations to compensate for lower internal CO2 concentrations resulting from increased stomatal closure. This is supported by lower photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiencies in the sandstone ridge specialists. Generalist species had lower water-use efficiencies than sandstone ridge specialists when growing on the drier, sandy ridgetops, but their nitrogen-use efficiencies did not differ from the species specialized to the more resource-rich alluvial valleys. We varied light environment and soil nutrient availability in a reciprocal transplant experiment involving two specialist species from each soil type. Edaphic specialist species, when grown on the soil type for which they were not specialized, were not capable of acclimatory shifts to achieve similar resource-use efficiencies as species specialized to that soil type. We conclude that divergent water-use strategies are an important mechanism underlying differences in edaphic associations and thus contributing to maintenance of high local tree species diversity in Bornean rain forests. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

This hypothesis was tested in more than 1200 gaps in a tropical forest in Panama over a 13- year period. Gaps increased seedling establishment and sapling densities, but this effect was nonspecific and broad-spectrum, and species richness per stem was identical in gaps and in nongap control sites. Spatial and temporal variation in the gap disturbance regime did not explain variation in species richness. The species composition of gaps was unpredictable even for pioneer tree species. Strong recruitment limitation appears to decouple the gap disturbance regime from control of tree diversity in this tropical forest.},

abstract = {This study investigated the mechanisms involved in the regulation of stomatal closure in Douglas-fir and evaluated the potential impact of compensatory adjustments in response to increasing tree height upon these mechanisms. In the laboratory, we measured leaf hydraulic conductance (K(leaf)) as leaf water potential (Psi(l)) declined for comparison with in situ diurnal patterns of stomatal conductance (g(s)) and Psi(l) in Douglas-fir across a height gradient, allowing us to infer linkages between diurnal changes in K(leaf) and g(s). A recently developed timed rehydration technique was used in conjunction with data from pressure-volume curves to develop hydraulic vulnerability curves for needles attached to small twigs. Laboratory-measured K(leaf) declined with increasing leaf water stress and was substantially reduced at Psi(l) values of -1.34, -1.45, -1.56 and -1.92 MPa for foliage sampled at mean heights of approximately 20, 35, 44 and 55 m, respectively. In situ g(s) measurements showed that stomatal closure was initiated at Psi(l) values of -1.21, -1.36, -1.74 and -1.86 MPa along the height gradient, which was highly correlated with Psi(l) values at loss of K(leaf). Cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that relative abundances of embolized tracheids in the central vein increased with increasing leaf water stress. Leaf embolism appeared to be coupled to changes in g(s) and might perform a vital function in stomatal regulation of plant water status and water transport in conifers. The observed trends in g(s) and K(leaf) in response to changes in Psi(l) along a height gradient suggest that the foliage at the tops of tall trees is capable of maintaining stomatal conductance at more negative Psi(l). This adaptation may allow taller trees to continue to photosynthesize during periods of greater water stress.},

abstract = {Although the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning has become a major focus in ecology, its significance in a fluctuating environment is still poorly understood. According to the insurance hypothesis, biodiversity insures ecosystems against declines in their functioning because many species provide greater guarantees that some will maintain functioning even if others fail. Here we examine this hypothesis theoretically. We develop a general stochastic dynamic model to assess the effects of species richness on the expected temporal mean and variance of ecosystem processes such as productivity, based on individual species' productivity responses to environmental fluctuations. Our model shows two major insurance effects of species richness on ecosystem productivity: (i) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal variance of productivity, and (ii) a performance-enhancing effect, i.e., an increase in the temporal mean of productivity. The strength of these insurance effects is determined by three factors: (i) the way ecosystem productivity is determined by individual species responses to environmental fluctuations, (ii) the degree of asynchronicity of these responses, and (iii) the detailed form of these responses. In particular, the greater the variance of the species responses, the lower the species richness at which the temporal mean of the ecosystem process saturates and the ecosystem becomes redundant. These results provide a strong theoretical foundation for the insurance hypothesis, which proves to be a fundamental principle for understanding the long-term effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {Comparisons of DNA from archaic and modern humans show that these groups interbred, and in some cases received an evolutionary advantage from doing so. This process - adaptive introgression - may lead to a faster rate of adaptation than is predicted from models with mutation and selection alone. Within the last couple of years, a series of studies have identified regions of the genome that are likely examples of adaptive introgression. In many cases, once a region was ascertained as being introgressed, commonly used statistics based on both haplotype as well as allele frequency information were employed to test for positive selection. Introgression by itself, however, changes both the haplotype structure and the distribution of allele frequencies, thus confounding traditional tests for detecting positive selection. Therefore, patterns generated by introgression alone may lead to false inferences of positive selection. Here we explore models involving both introgression and positive selection to investigate the behavior of various statistics under adaptive introgression. In particular, we find that the number and allelic frequencies of sites that are uniquely shared between archaic humans and specific present-day populations are particularly useful for detecting adaptive introgression. We then examine the 1000 Genomes dataset to characterize the landscape of uniquely shared archaic alleles in human populations. Finally, we identify regions that were likely subject to adaptive introgression and discuss some of the most promising candidate genes located in these regions.},

abstract = {The coexistence of many competing species in an ecological community is a long-standing theoretical and empirical puzzle. Classic approaches in ecology assume that species fitness and interactions in a given environment are mainly driven by a few essential species traits, and coexistence canbe explained by trade-offs between these traits. The apparent diversity of species is then summarized by their positions ("ecological niches") in a low-dimensional trait space. Yet, in a complex community, any particular set of traits and trade-offs is unlikely to encompass the full organization of the community. A diametrically opposite approach assumes that species interactions aredisordered, i.e., essentially random, as might arise when many species traits combine in complex ways. This approach is appealing theoretically, and can lead to novel emergent phenomena, fundamentally different from the picture painted by low-dimensional theories. Nonetheless, fully disordered interactions are incompatible with many-species coexistence, and neither disorder nor its dynamical consequences have received direct empirical support so far. Here we ask what happens when random species interactions are minimally constrained by coexistence. We show theoretically that this leads to testable predictions. Species interactions remain highly disordered, yet with a "diffuse"statistical structure: interaction strengths are biased so that successful competitors subtly favor each other, and correlated so that competitors partition their impacts on other species. We provide strong empirical evidence for this pattern, in data from grassland biodiversity experiments that match our predictions quantitatively. This is a first-of-a-kind test of disorder on empirically measured interactions, and unique evidence that species interactions and coexistence emerge from anunderlying high-dimensional space of ecological traits. Our findings provide a new null model for inferring interaction networks with minimal prior information and a set of empirical fingerprints that support a statistical physics-inspired approach of complex ecosystems.},

Trait-based investigations of abundance distributions have generally focused on species-mean trait values with mixed success. Here, using large tropical tree seedling datasets in China and Puerto Rico, we take an alternative approach that considers the magnitude of intraspecific variation in traits and growth as it relates to species abundance. We find that common species are less variable in their traits and growth. Common species also occupy core positions within community trait space indicating that they are finely tuned for the available conditions. Rare species are functionally peripheral and are likely transients struggling for success in the given environment. The work highlights the importance of considering intraspecific variation in trait-based ecology and demonstrates asymmetry in the magnitude of intraspecific variation among species is critical for understanding of how traits are related to abundance.},

abstract = {Question: When can we assume that inter-specific trait variation is higher than intra-specific trait variation in plant community ecology? Location: Old-growth deciduous forest in the Gault Nature Reserve, Mount St. Hilaire (Quebec, Canada,45′32.957″ N, 73′08.884″ W), with a shorter environmental gradient than normally exists in community studies. Methods: We measured 15 functional traits on all tree saplings occurring in 39 (5-7-m radius) sample plots. Using variance decomposition from mixed models and from sums of squares of community-weighted traits, we determined the relative importance of temporal, spatial, inter-specific, intra-specific and intra-individual variation in each trait. In total, we collected trait information on 3317 leaves from 786 twigs sampled on 422 saplings. Results: For 12 of 15 traits, over 50{\%} of the total variance existed between species and inter-specific variation was always the most important source of variation. However for 14 traits, intra-specific and environmental variation represented up to 28{\%} of the total variation. Variation in community-weighted trait means was mostly generated by changes in species composition, but intra-specific trait variation was the dominate cause for leaf nitrogen, specific leaf area and tree branching. The intra-individual and temporal sources of variation were not important. Conclusions: Trait variation should be dominated by inter-specific differences in most studies since they involve systems with more pronounced environmental gradients, higher species richness and more $\beta$-diversity than used here. However, in studies with short gradients, or when using more plastic traits, it will be necessary to measure trait values for each site. It is important to quantify the $\beta$-diversity of the environmental gradients in question in order to compare results across studies. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

abstract = {The role of hybridization in adaptive evolution is contentious. While many cases of adaptive trait introgression have been proposed, the relevant traits have rarely been identified, resulting in a lack of clear examples of this process. Here, we examine a purported case of adaptive introgression in which the annual sunflower Helianthus annuus annuus has captured alleles from a congener (Helianthus debilis) to form a stabilized hybrid, Helianthus annuus texanus. We tested the hypotheses that herbivore resistance traits have introgressed from H. debilis to H. annuus and have increased adaptation in the latter. In two common gardens, fitness (estimated by seed production) was on average 55{\%} higher in H. a. texanus than in H. a. annuus. For H. a. texanus, three damage traits (of seven tested) differed significantly from the H. a. annuus parent in one or both sites and were shifted in the direction of the more resistant H. debilis. Natural selection favored H. a. annuusxH. debilis BC(1) hybrids (synthesized to mimic the ancestors of H. a. texanus) with H. debilis-like resistance to seed midges Neolasioptera helianthis and to receptacle/seed feeding Lepidoptera at one or both sites. Assuming similar herbivore pressures in the past, these results suggest that introgression of biotic resistance traits was important in the adaptation of H. annuus to central and southern Texas.},

abstract = {Competition for light, treefall gap formation and recruitment are the critical phenomena in the genesis of tropical rain forests. These aspects are taken into account to build a new spatially explicit forest growth model called TROLL. Competition for light is modelled by calculating exactly the three-dimensional field of photosynthetically active radiation in the forest understorey. Typically, 106 light intensities are computed per hectare at each time step. This light field controls the growth of each tree and establishment/death events. Seed dispersal, dormancy and establishment success as well as a model of treefalls are also included. A special care is paid to the justification and to the validation of each of these modules. The TROLL model is parameterized for a Neotropical rain forest in French Guiana using 12 functional groups of species. Using this model the vertical canopy structure and the tree diametric distribution are investigated. The role of treefalls in maintaining pioneer species is also evidenced. A forest succession scenario is simulated and compared to field data. The model is then used to simulate the recolonization of a previously sterilized area by a rain forest plant community. This scenario is interpreted using information available from palaeorecords over the Holocene period and their validity is discussed. It is suggested that this model could be used to study mosaic-like patterns in rain forests, installation of slowly dispersing species, speciation hypotheses and landscape scale dynamics of rain forests.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of lidar-derived methods in plant ecology and forestry. One limitation to these methods is accessing the information content of point clouds, from which tree-scale metrics can be retrieved. This is currently undertaken through laborious and time-consuming manual segmentation of tree-level point clouds from larger-area point clouds, an effort that is impracticable across thousands of stems. Here, we present treeseg, an open-source software to automate this task. This method utilises generic point cloud processing techniques including Euclidean clustering, principal component analysis, region-based segmentation, shape fitting and connectivity testing. This data-driven approach uses few a priori assumptions of tree architecture, and transferability across lidar instruments is constrained only by data quality requirements. We demonstrate the treeseg algorithm here on data acquired from both a structurally simple open forest and a complex tropical forest. Across these data, we successfully automatically extract 96{\%} and 70{\%} of trees, respectively, with the remainder requiring some straightforward manual segmentation. treeseg allows ready and quick access to tree-scale information contained in lidar point clouds. treeseg should help contribute to more wide-scale uptake of lidar-derived methods to applications ranging from the estimation of carbon stocks through to descriptions of plant form and function.},

abstract = {Over-exploitation and fragmentation are serious problems for tropical forests. Most sustainable forest management practices avoid clear-cuts and apply selective logging systems focused on a few commercial species. We applied a simulation model to estimate the impact of such selective logging scenarios on the genetic diversity and demography of four tropical tree species from French Guiana. The simulations used data on genetic and demographic composition, growth, phenology and pollen and seed dispersal obtained for Dicorynia guianensis, Sextonia rubra, Symphonia globulifera and Vouacapoua americana at the experimental site in Paracou. Whereas Symphonia globulifera serves as a model for a species with low logging pressure, the other three species represent the most exploited tree species in French Guiana. In simulations with moderate logging, typical for French Guiana, with large cutting diameter ({\textgreater}60 cm diameter) and long cutting cycles (65 years), the two species V. americana and Sextonia rubra were not able to recover their initial stock at the end of the rotation period, with a large decrease in the number of individuals and in basal area. Under a more intensive logging system (cutting diameter {\textgreater}45 cm diameter, cutting cycles of 30 years) that is common practice in the Brazilian Amazon, only Symphonia globulifera showed no negative impact. Generally, the differences between the genetic parameters in the control scenarios without logging and the logging scenarios were surprisingly small. The main reasons for this were the overlapping of generations and the effective dispersal ability of gene vectors in all species, which guarantee relative homogeneity of the genetic structure in different age classes. Nevertheless, decreasing the population size by logging reduced the number of genotypes and caused higher genetic distances between the original population and the population at the end of the logging cycles. Sensitivity analysis showed that genetic changes in the logging scenarios were principally determined by the growth, densities and cutting diameter of each species, and only to a very small extent by the reproductive system including factors such as pollen and seed dispersal and flowering phenology. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The breadth of the continuum concept of strategy with respect to succession was tested on 21 tree and shrub species common in either unlogged or logged stands, respectively, in the Forest Reserve of Caparo, Venezuela, by examining morphological, physiological and population characteristics. Based on a preliminary abundance analysis, 'early', 'mid' and 'late' successional species as well as 'generalists' were distinguished. Early successional species, i.e. Ochroma lagopus, Heliocarpus popayanensis and Cecropia peltata were similar in many autecological aspects, e.g. monolayered leaf arrangement, orthotropic architectural models, no adaptive reiteration, clumped distribution, but differed in gap association and distribution along a drainage gradient. Mid-successional species established themselves both in large and small gaps ({\textgreater} 300 m2; 80-300 m2) and showed a clumped to regular distribution pattern in logged areas; they exhibited more diverse crown and leaf characteristics than early successional species. Late successional species established themselves only in small gaps and understorey, and showed a regular spatial pattern in undisturbed areas. All late successional species displayed architectural models with plagiotropic lateral axes and showed a multilayered leaf arrangement. Adaptive reiteration was a common feature of late successional species which could be further subdivided into large, medium-sized and small trees, indicating different light requirements at maturity. Generalists were common treelet and shrub species in both disturbed and undisturbed sites where they are also capable of completing their life cycle. The light compensation point (LCP) of an individual plant was strongly influenced by its crown illuminance. Large late successional species showed the widest range of LCP values, reflecting the increasing light availability with increasing height in mature forest. On the basis of many autecological characteristics, it was found (i) that there is in fact a continuum of species strategies with respect to succession even among early and mid-successional species and (ii) that the latter group of species showed the widest breadth of autecological traits, reflecting the heterogeneous environment in which they establish and mature.

abstract = {Changes in specific leaf area (SLA, projected leaf area per unit leaf dry mass) and nitrogen partitioning between pro- teins within leaves occur during the acclimation of plants to their growth irradiance. In this paper, the relative impor- tance of both of these changes in maximizing carbon gain is quantified. Photosynthesis, SLA and nitrogen partitioning within leaves was determined from 10 dicotyledonous C 3 species grown in photon irradiances of 200 and 1000 m mol m - 2 s - 1 . Photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area measured under the growth irradiance was, on average, three times higher for high-light-grown plants than for those grown under low light, and two times higher when measured near light saturation. However, light-saturated photosynthetic rate per unit leaf dry mass was unaltered by growth irradi- ance because low-light plants had double the SLA. Nitro- gen concentrations per unit leaf mass were constant between the two light treatments, but plants grown in low light partitioned a larger fraction of leaf nitrogen into light harvesting. Leaf absorptance was curvilinearly related to chlorophyll content and independent of SLA. Daily photo- synthesis per unit leaf dry mass under low-light conditions was much more responsive to changes in SLA than to nitro- gen partitioning. Under high light, sensitivity to nitrogen partitioning increased, but changes in SLA were still more important.},

abstract = {Across the complex matrix of microsites that compose tropical forests, light availability varies more dramatically than any other single plant resource. On a sunny day, instantaneous measurements of photosynthetically active radiation range over 3 orders of magnitude, from less than 10 {\{}$\backslash$textmu{\}}mol m-2 s-1 in closed-canopy understory of mature forests to well over 1000 {\{}$\backslash$textmu{\}}mol m-2 s-1 in exposed microsites of gaps and large clearings, or at the top of the forest canopy (Chazdon {\{}{\&}{\}} Fetcher, 1984b; Figure 1.1). Among the environmental factors that influence plant growth and survival in tropical forests, light availability is likely to be the resource most frequently limiting growth, survival, and reproduction (Chazdon, 1988; Fetcher, Oberbauer {\{}{\&}{\}} Chazdon, 1994). Photosynthetic utilization of light is therefore a major component of the regeneration responses of forest species within the larger context of forest dynamics and succession.},

abstract = {Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) are common tools in biogeography and conservation ecology. It has been repeatedly claimed that aggregated (stacked) SDMs (S-SDMs) will overestimate species richness. One recently suggested solution to this problem is to use macroecological models of species richness to constrain S-SDMs. Here, we examine current practice in the development of S-SDMs to identify methodological problems, provide tools to overcome these issues, and quantify the performance of correctly stacked S-SDMs alongside macroecological models. Locations Barents Sea, Europe and Dutch Wadden Sea. Methods We present formal mathematical arguments demonstrating how S-SDMs should and should not be stacked. We then compare the performance of macroecological models and correctly stacked S-SDMs on the same data to determine if the former can be used to constrain the latter. Next, we develop a maximum-likelihood approach to adjusting S-SDMs and discuss how it could potentially be used in combination with macroecological models. Finally, we use this tool to quantify how S-SDMs deviate from observed richness in four very different case studies. Results We demonstrate that stacking methods based on thresholding site-level occurrence probabilities will almost always be biased, and that these biases will tend toward systematic overprediction of richness. Next, we show that correctly stacked S-SDMs perform very similarly to macroecological models in that they both have a tendency to overpredict richness in species-poor sites and underpredict it in species-rich sites. Main conclusions Our results suggest that the perception that S-SDMs consistently overpredict richness is driven largely by incorrect stacking methods. With these biases removed, S-SDMs perform similarly to macroecological models, suggesting that combining the two model classes will not offer much improvement. However, if situations where coupling S-SDMs and macroecological models would be beneficial are subsequently identified, the tools we develop would facilitate such a synthesis.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that accounting for intraspecific trait variation (ITV) may better address major questions in community ecology. However, a general picture of the relative extent of ITV compared to interspecific trait variation in plant communities is still missing. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relative extent of ITV within and among plant communities worldwide, using a data set encompassing 629 communities (plots) and 36 functional traits. Overall, ITV accounted for 25{\%} of the total trait variation within communities and 32{\%} of the total trait variation among communities on average. The relative extent of ITV tended to be greater for whole-plant (e.g. plant height) vs. organ-level traits and for leaf chemical (e.g. leaf N and P concentration) vs. leaf morphological (e.g. leaf area and thickness) traits. The relative amount of ITV decreased with increasing species richness and spatial extent, but did not vary with plant growth form or climate. These results highlight global patterns in the relative importance of ITV in plant communities, providing practical guidelines for when researchers should include ITV in trait-based community and ecosystem studies.},

abstract = {1. We examined changes in leaf structure and photosynthetic characteristics in two congeneric shrub species growing across natural gap transects in a tropical rain forest. 2. Piper sancti-felicis, a shrub characteristic of disturbed clearings and large gaps, exhibits a high capacity to alter photosynthetic capacity in response to spatial variation in light availability compared to the shade-tolerant species Piper arieianum. 3. Rooted cuttings were placed in pots along transects in each of two recent, naturally formed canopy gaps in old-growth forest. After 13 months of growth, a subsample of 14 plants per species (seven pairs per gap) was chosen for detailed analyses of leaf light environment and photosynthetic light responses. For 10 of these pairs, leaf tissue was sampled for subsequent anatomical characteristics. 4. Photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf area of Piper sancti-felicis showed a strong dependence on all measures of light availability, whereas Piper arieianum showed a weak or insignificant light acclimation response. Photosynthetic capacity and dark respiration per unit leaf mass increased significantly with light availability only for Piper sancti-felicis. Both species exhibited significant light-dependent variation in leaf mass per area and thickness of mesophyll layers, although only Piper arieianum showed light-related variation in total leaf thickness. Photosynthetic capacity of Piper arieianum was poorly correlated with leaf anatomical features, whereas leaves of Piper sancti-felicis showed significant, positive correlations between photosynthetic capacity and mesophyll tissue thickness. The limited potential for light acclimation in the shade species Piper arieianum reflects an inability to adjust metabolic processes at the cellular level, despite extensive anatomical adjustments. Light acclimation in the high-light species Piper sancti-felicis, in contrast, is effected by biochemical adjustments at the cellular level as well as by changes in leaf anatomy. F},

abstract = {Abstract Plant diversity can increase biomass production in plot‐scale studies, but applying these results to ecosystem carbon (C) storage at larger spatial and temporal scales remains problematic. Other ecosystem controls interact with diversity and plant production, and may influence soil pools differently from plant pools. We integrated diversity with the state‐factor framework, which identifies key controls, or ‘state factors', over ecosystem properties and services such as C storage. We used this framework to assess the effects of diversity, plant traits and state factors (climate, topography, time) on live tree, standing dead, organic horizon and total C in Qu{\'{e}}bec forests. Four patterns emerged: (1) while state factors were usually the most important model predictors, models with both state and biotic factors (mean plant traits and diversity) better predicted C pools; (2) mean plant traits were better predictors than diversity; (3) diversity increased live tree C but reduced organic horizon C; (4) different C pools responded to different traits and diversity metrics. These results suggest that, where ecosystem properties result from multiple processes, no simple relationship may exist with any one organismal factor. Integrating biodiversity into ecosystem ecology and assessing both traits and diversity improves our mechanistic understanding of biotic effects on ecosystems.},

abstract = {Two different approaches currently prevail for predicting spatial patterns of species assemblages. The first approach (macroecological modelling, MEM) focuses directly on realized properties of species assemblages, whereas the second approach (stacked species distribution modelling, S-SDM) starts with constituent species to approximate the properties of assemblages. Here, we propose to unify the two approaches in a single 'spatially explicit species assemblage modelling' (SESAM) framework. This framework uses relevant designations of initial species source pools for modelling, macroecological variables, and ecological assembly rules to constrain predictions of the richness and composition of species assemblages obtained by stacking predictions of individual species distributions. We believe that such a framework could prove useful in many theoretical and applied disciplines of ecology and evolution, both for improving our basic understanding of species assembly across spatio-temporal scales and for anticipating expected consequences of local, regional or global environmental changes. In this paper, we propose such a framework and call for further developments and testing across a broad range of community types in a variety of environments},

abstract = {The greater area of tropical forest biomes has been proposed as a factor that drives the latitudinal gradient in species diversity by modulating speciation and extinction rates. But speciation and extinction are processes that operate over millions of years, so an adequate test of area's contribution to diversity patterns must take into consideration that biome areas have changed through time in response to climate. Here we correlate estimates of current tree species diversity with a composite parameter integrating area over geological time for each continent's tropical, temperate, and boreal biomes.We find significant positive correlations between current tree diversity and area-time for periods since the Eocene, Oligocene, and Miocene, which we take as evidence for a time-integrated speciesarea effect on current patterns of species richness across biomes. These results contribute to explanations for why most lineages have tropical origins and why tropical forests are more diverse than extratropical forests.},

abstract = {Populations are locally adapted when populations have the highest relative fitness at their home sites, and lower fitness in other parts of the range. Results from the extensive experimental plantations of populations of forest trees from different parts of the range show that populations can survive and grow in broad areas outside the home site. However, intra- and interspecific competition limit the distribution of genotypes. For populations from large parts of the range, relative fitness, compared with the local population, is often highest at the home site. At the edges of the range, this local adaptation may break down. The extent of local adaptation is determined by the balance between gene flow and selection. Genetic differentiation and strong natural selection occur over a range of tens or hundreds of kilometers, but reliable measurements of gene flow are available only for much shorter distances.

abstract = {1. Root, stem and leaf traits are thought to be functionally coordinated to maximize the efficiency of acquiring and using limited resources. However, evidence is mixed for consistent whole-plant trait coordination among woody plants, and we lack a clear understanding of the adaptive value of root traits along soil resource gradients. If fine roots are the below-ground analogue to leaves, then low specific root length (SRL) and high tissue density should be common on infertile soil. Here, we test the prediction that root, stem and leaf traits and relative growth rate respond in unison with soil fertility gradients. 2. We measured fine root, stem and leaf traits and relative growth rate on individual seedlings of 66 tree species grown in controlled conditions. Our objectives were (i) to determine whether multiple root traits align with growth rate, leaf and stem traits and with each other and (ii) to quantify the relationships between community-weighted mean root traits and two strong soil fertility gradients that differed in spatial extent and community composition. 3. At the species level, fast growth rates were associated with low root and stem tissue density and high specific leaf area. SRL and root diameter were not clearly related to growth rate and loaded on a separate principal component from the plant economic spectrum. 4. At the community level, growth rate was positively related to soil fertility, and root tissue density (RTD) and branching were negatively related to soil fertility. SRL was negatively related and root diameter was positively related to soil fertility on the large-scale gradient that included ectomycor-rhizal angiosperms. 5. Synthesis. Root, stem and leaf tissue traits of tree seedlings are coordinated and influence fitness along soil fertility gradients. RTD responds in unison with above-ground traits to soil fertility gradi-ents; however, root traits are multidimensional because SRL is orthogonal to the plant economic spectrum. In contrast to leaves, trees are not constrained in the way they construct fine roots: plants can construct high or low SRL roots of any tissue density. High RTD is the most consistent below-ground trait that reflects adaptation to infertile soil.},

abstract = {We investigated performance trade-offs among seedlings of nine tropical tree species during a -five-year field experiment. Seedlings were grown in eight microhabitat types composed of paired gap and shaded understory sites in each of four soil types. We defined performance trade-offs relevant to coexistence as significant pairwise rank reversals for species performance between contrasting situations, of which we characterize three types: microhabitat, fitness component, and ontogenetic. Only 2 of 36 species pairs exhibited microhabitat trade-offs or reversed rankings for survival or relative growth rate (RGR) among microhabitats, and only one species pair reversed performance ranks among soil types. We found stronger evidence for rank reversals between fitness components (survival and RGR), particularly in gap vs. understory environments, suggesting a general trade-off between shade tolerance (survival in shade) and gap establishment (RGR in gaps). Third, the most frequent rank reversals between species pairs occurred between early and later ontogenetic stages, especially between fitness components in contrasting microhabitats. Overall, 15 of 36 pairs of potentially competing species exhibited some type of seedling performance trade-off, two species pairs never outperformed one another, and for 19 species pairs one species was a consistent better performer. We suggest that ontogenetic trade-offs, in concert with microhabitat and fitness component trade-offs, may contribute to species coexistence of long-lived organisms such as tropical trees.},

abstract = {Key message: This review highlights some of the discoveries and applications made possible by “omics” technologies over the last 10 years and provides perspectives for pioneering research to increase our understanding of tree biology. Context: A decade after the first forest tree genome sequence was released into the public domain, the rapidly evolving genomics and bioinformatics toolbox has advanced our understanding of the structure, functioning, and evolution of forest tree genomes. Aims and methods: This review highlights some of the discoveries and applications that “omics” technologies have made possible for forest trees over the past 10 years. Results: In this review, we start by our current understanding of genome evolution and intricacies of gene regulation for reproduction, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. We then skim over advances in interactome analysis and epigenomics, the knowledge of the extent of genetic variation within and between species, revealing micro- and macro-evolutionary processes and species history, together with the complex architecture of quantitative traits. We finally end with applications in genetic resource conservation and breeding. Conclusion: The knowledge gained through the use of these technologies has a huge potential impact for adapting forests to the main challenges they will have to face: changing demand from ecosystem services with potentially conflicting strategies in terms of conservation and use, as well as climate changes and associated threats. Genomics will undoubtedly play a major role over the next decade and beyond, not only to further understand the mechanisms underlying adaptation and evolution but also to develop and implement innovative management and policy actions to preserve the adaptability of natural forests and intensively managed plantations.},

abstract = {The MaxEnt software package is one of the most popular tools for species distribution and environmental niche modeling, with over 1000 published applications since 2006. Its popularity is likely for two reasons: 1) MaxEnt typically outperforms other methods based on predictive accuracy and 2) the software is particularly easy to use. MaxEnt users must make a number of decisions about how they should select their input data and choose from a wide variety of settings in the software package to build models from these data. The underlying basis for making these decisions is unclear in many studies, and default settings are apparently chosen, even though alternative settings are often more appropriate. In this paper, we provide a detailed explanation of how MaxEnt works and a prospectus on modeling options to enable users to make informed decisions when preparing data, choosing settings and interpreting output. We explain how the choice of background samples reflects prior assumptions, how nonlinear functions of environmental variables (features) are created and selected, how to account for environmentally biased sampling, the interpretation of the various types of model output and the challenges for model evaluation. We demonstrate MaxEnt's calculations using both simplified simulated data and occurrence data from South Africa on species of the flowering plant family Proteaceae. Throughout, we show how MaxEnt's outputs vary in response to different settings to highlight the need for making biologically motivated modeling decisions.},

abstract = {The eastern North American white oaks, a complex of approximately 16 potentially interbreeding species, have become a classic model for studying the genetic nature of species in a syngameon. Genetic work over the past two decades has demonstrated the reality of oak species, but gene flow between sympatric oaks raises the question of whether there are conserved regions of the genome that define oak species. Does gene flow homogenize the entire genome? Do the regions of the genome that distinguish a species in one part of its range differ from the regions that distinguish it in other parts of its range, where it grows in sympatry with different species? Or are there regions of the genome that are relatively conserved across species ranges? In this study, we revisit seven species of the eastern North American white oak syngameon using a set of 80 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected in a previous study because they show differences among, and consistency within, the species. We test the hypothesis that there exist segments of the genome that do not become homogenized by repeated introgression, but retain distinct alleles characteristic of each species. We undertake a range-wide sampling to investigate whether SNPs that appeared to be fixed based on a relatively small sample in our previous work are fixed or nearly fixed across the range of the species. Each of the seven species remains genetically distinct across its range, given our diagnostic set of markers, with relatively few individuals exhibiting admixture of multiple species. SNPs map back to all 12 Quercus linkage groups (chromosomes) and are separated from each other by an average of 7.47 million bp (± 8.74 million bp, SD), but are significantly clustered relative to a random null distribution, suggesting that our SNP toolkit reflects genome-wide patterns of divergence while potentially being concentrated in regions of the genome that reflect a higher-than-average history of among-species divergence. This application of a DNA toolkit designed for the simple problem of identifying species in the field has two important implications. First, the eastern North American white oak syngameon is composed of entities that most taxonomists would consider "good species." Second, and more fundamentally, species in the syngameon are genetically coherent because characteristic portions of the genome remain divergent despite a history of introgression. Understanding the conditions under which some loci diverge while others introgress is key to understanding the origins and maintenance of global tree diversity.},

abstract = {Species diversity and genetic diversity remain the nearly exclusive domains of community ecology and population genetics, respectively, despite repeated recognition in the literature over the past 30 years of close parallels between these two levels of diversity. Species diversity within communities and genetic diversity within populations are hypothesized to co-vary in space or time because of locality characteristics that influence the two levels of diversity via parallel processes, or because of direct effects of one level of diversity on the other via several different mechanisms. Here, we draw on a wide range of studies in ecology and evolution to examine the theoretical underpinnings of these hypotheses, review relevant empirical literature, and outline an agenda for future research. The plausibility of species diversity-genetic diversity relationships is supported by a variety of theoretical and empirical studies, and several recent studies provide direct, though preliminary support. Focusing on potential connections between species diversity and genetic diversity complements other approaches to synthesis at the ecology-evolution interface, and should contribute to conceptual unification of biodiversity research at the levels of genes and species. {\textcopyright}2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Tocopherols are a class of four natural compounds that can provide nutrition and function as antioxidant in both plants and animals. Maize kernels have low $\alpha$-tocopherol content, the compound with the highest vitamin E activity, thus, raising the risk of vitamin E deficiency in human populations relying on maize as their primary vitamin E source. In this study, two insertion/deletions (InDels) within a gene encoding $\gamma$-tocopherol methyltransferase, Zea mays VTE4 (ZmVTE4), and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located {\~{}}85 kb upstream of ZmVTE4 were identified to be significantly associated with $\alpha$-tocopherol levels in maize kernels by conducting an association study with a panel of {\~{}}500 diverse inbred lines. Linkage analysis in three populations that segregated at either one of these three polymorphisms but not at the other two suggested that the three polymorphisms could affect $\alpha$-tocopherol content independently. Furthermore, we found that haplotypes of the two InDels could explain ∼33{\%} of $\alpha$-tocopherol variation in the association panel, suggesting ZmVTE4 is a major gene involved in natural phenotypic variation of $\alpha$-tocopherol. One of the two InDels is located within the promoter region and associates with ZmVTE4 transcript level. This information can not only help in understanding the underlying mechanism of natural tocopherol variations in maize kernels, but also provide valuable markers for marker-assisted breeding of $\alpha$-tocopherol content in maize kernels, which will then facilitate the improvement of maize as a better source of daily vitamin E nutrition.},

abstract = {Ecologists are increasingly interested in predicting how intraspecific variation and changing trait values impact species interactions and community composition. For many traits, much of this variation is caused by phenotypic plasticity, and thus the impact of plasticity on species coexistence deserves robust quantification. Partly due to a lack of sound theoretical expectations, empirical studies make contradictory claims regarding plasticity effects on coexistence. Our critical review of this literature, framed in modern coexistence theory, reveals that plasticity affects species interactions in ways that could impact stabilizing niche differences and competitive asymmetries. However, almost no study integrates these measures to quantify the net effect of plasticity on species coexistence. To address this challenge, we outline novel empirical approaches grounded in modern theory.},

@article{Hairston2005,
abstract = {Recent studies have documented rates of evolution of ecologically important phenotypes sufficiently fast that they have the potential to impact the outcome of ecological interactions while they are underway. Observations of this type go against accepted wisdom that ecological and evolutionary dynamics occur at very different time scales. While some authors have evaluated the rapidity of a measured evolutionary rate by comparing it to the overall distribution of measured evolutionary rates, we believe that ecologists are mainly interested in rapid evolution because of its potential to impinge on ecological processes. We therefore propose that rapid evolution be defined as a genetic change occurring rapidly enough to have a measurable impact on simultaneous ecological change. Using this definition we propose a framework for decomposing rates of ecological change into components driven by simultaneous evolutionary change and by change in a non-evolutionary factor (e.g. density dependent population dynamics, abiotic environmental change). Evolution is judged to be rapid in this ecological context if its contribution to ecological change is large relative to the contribution of other factors. We provide a worked example of this approach based on a theoretical predator-prey interaction [Abrams, P. {\&} Matsuda, H. (1997). Evolution, 51, 1740], and find that in this system the impact of prey evolution on predator per capita growth rate is 63{\%} that of internal ecological dynamics. We then propose analytical methods for measuring these contributions in field situations, and apply them to two long-term data sets for which suitable ecological and evolutionary data exist. For both data sets relatively high rates of evolutionary change have been found when measured as character change in standard deviations per generation (haldanes). For Darwin's finches evolving in response to fluctuating rainfall [Grant, P.R. {\&} Grant, B.R. (2002). Science, 296, 707], we estimate that evolutionary change has been more rapid than ecological change by a factor of 2.2. For a population of freshwater copepods whose life history evolves in response to fluctuating fish predation [Hairston, N.G. Jr {\&} Dillon, T.A. (1990). Evolution, 44,1796], we find that evolutionary change has been about one quarter the rate of ecological change - less than in the finch example, but nevertheless substantial. These analyses support the view that in order to understand temporal dynamics in ecological processes it is critical to consider the extent to which the attributes of the system under investigation are simultaneously changing as a result of rapid evolution. {\textcopyright}2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {The research of a generation of ecologists was catalysed by the recognition that the number and identity of species in communities influences the functioning of ecosystems. The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) is most often examined by controlling spe-cies richness and randomising community composition. In natural systems, biodiversity changes are often part of a bigger community assembly dynamic. Therefore, focusing on community assembly and the functioning of ecosystems (CAFE), by integrating both species richness and composition through species gains, losses and changes in abundance, will better reveal how com-munity changes affect ecosystem function. We synthesise the BEF and CAFE perspectives using an ecological application of the Price equation, which partitions the contributions of richness and composition to function. Using empirical examples, we show how the CAFE approach reveals important contributions of composition to function. These examples show how changes in species richness and composition driven by environmental perturbations can work in concert or antago-nistically to influence ecosystem function. Considering how communities change in an integrative fashion, rather than focusing on one axis of community structure at a time, will improve our abil-ity to anticipate and predict changes in ecosystem function.},

The two Eucalyptus mosaic trees studied here (E. melliodora and E. sideroxylon) are predominantly susceptible to insect herbivory, with the leaves on a single large branch on each tree resisting herbivory. We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-pressure liquid chromatography to analyze the chemical profile of leaves of the mosaic trees, as well as leaves of adjacent non-mosaic con-specifics. We show that the leaves of the two phenotypes are distinctly different. Compared to the susceptible (S) leaves on the same tree, the resistant (R) leaves on the mosaic trees had low concentrations of sesquiterpenes (E. melliodora: 2 vs. 24 mg{\textperiodcentered}g-1 dry matter; E. sideroxylon: 8 vs. 22 mg{\textperiodcentered}g-1 dry matter), high concentrations of FPCs (E. melliodora: 5. 4 vs. 0. 3 mg{\textperiodcentered}g-1 dry matter; E. sideroxylon: 9. 8 vs. 0. 2 mg{\textperiodcentered}g-1 dry matter) but similar concentrations of nitrogen (E. melliodora: 15. 4 vs. 16. 8 mg{\textperiodcentered}g-1 dry matter; E. sideroxylon: 13. 1 vs. 14. 0 mg{\textperiodcentered}g-1 dry matter). The only difference between the two mosaic trees was in the levels of monoterpenes. The R leaves from the mosaic E. melliodora contained higher concentrations of monoterpenes compared to the S leaves (12 vs. 6 mg{\textperiodcentered}g-1 dry matter). In contrast, the leaves from the E. sideroxylon mosaic contained much higher concentrations of monoterpenes with a reversed pattern (R: 26 vs. S: 45 mg{\textperiodcentered}g-1 dry matter). There were qualitative differences too on the mosaic trees. The R leaves of both species contained much higher concentrations of the monoterpene, 1,8-cineole, whereas the S chemotype of E. sideroxylon only had high concentrations of phellandrenes. Furthermore, the chemical differences between leaves on the R and S branches of the mosaic trees resembled those between the leaves of R and S con-specific trees in the same population. We use these data and knowledge of secondary metabolite biosynthesis to propose that high-level transcriptional differences may control the profile of specialized metabolites in eucalypts. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Background: Long-lived trees can accumulate mutations throughout their lifetimes that may influence biotic and abiotic interactions. For example, some Eucalyptus trees display marked variation in herbivore defence within a single canopy. These " mosaic" trees support foliage with distinct chemotypes which are differentially favoured by insect and vertebrate herbivores, resulting in susceptible and resistant branches within a single canopy. These mosaic trees provide a unique opportunity to explore the biosynthesis and genetic regulation of chemical defences in the foliage. The biosynthesis of the principal defence compounds, terpenoid-dominated essential oils, is well understood. However, the regulation of the genes involved and thus the control of phenotypic variation within a single tree canopy remains a mystery.Results: We sequenced the transcriptomes of the leaves of the two different chemotypes of a chemically mosaic Eucalyptus melliodora tree using 454 pyrosequencing technology. We used gene set enrichment analysis to identify differentially expressed transcripts and found the proportion of differentially expressed genes in the resistant and susceptible foliage similar to the transcript difference between functionally distinct tissues of the same organism, for example roots and leaves. We also investigated sequence differences in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms and found 10 nucleotides that were different between the two branches. These are likely true SNPs and several occur in regulatory genes.Conclusion: We found three lines of evidence that suggest changes to a 'master switch' can result in large scale phenotypic changes: 1. We found differential expression of terpene biosynthetic genes between the two chemotypes that could contribute to chemical variation within this plant. 2. We identified many genes that are differentially expressed between the two chemotypes, including some unique genes in each branch. These genes are involved in a variety of processes within the plant and many could contribute to the regulation of secondary metabolism, thus contributing to the chemical variation. 3. We identified 10 SNPs, some of which occur in regulatory genes that could influence secondary metabolism and thus contribute to chemical variation. Whilst this research is inherently limited by sample size, the patterns we describe could be indicative of other plant genetic mosaics. {\textcopyright} 2013 Padovan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Adaptations to resource availability strongly shape patterns of community composition along successional gradients in environmental conditions. In the present study, we examined the extent to which variation in functional composition explains shifts in trait-based functional strategies in young tropical secondary forests during the most dynamic stage of succession (0-20 years). Functional composition of two size classes in 51 secondary forest plots was determined using community-weighted means of seven functional traits, which were intensively measured on 55 woody plant species (n = 875-1,761 individuals). Along the successional gradient in forest structure, there was a significant and consistent shift in functional strategies from resource acquisition to resource conservation. Leaf toughness and adult plant size increased significantly, while net photosynthetic capacity (A(mass)) decreased significantly during succession. Shifts in functional strategies within size classes for A(mass) and wood density also support the hypothesis that changes in functional composition are shaped by environmental conditions along successional gradients. In general, 'hard' functional traits, e.g., A(mass) and leaf toughness, linked to different facets of plant performance exhibited greater sensitivity to successional changes in forest structure than 'soft' traits, such as leaf mass area and leaf dry matter content. Our results also suggested that stochastic processes related to previous land-use history, dispersal limitation, and abiotic factors explained variation in functional composition beyond that attributed to deterministic shifts in functional strategies. Further data on seed dispersal vectors and distance and landscape configuration are needed to improve current mechanistic models of succession in tropical secondary forests.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, accelerating rates of species extinction have prompted an increasing number of studies to reduce the number of species experimentally in a variety of ecosystems and examine how this aspect of diversity alters the efficiency by which communities capture biologically essential resources and convert them into new tissue. Here we summarize the results of 164 experiments (reported in 84 publications) that have manipulated the richness of primary producers, herbivores, detritivores, or predators in a variety of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and examined how this impacts (1) the standing stock abundance or biomass of the focal trophic group, (2) the abundance or biomass of that trophic group's primary resource(s), and/or (3) the extent to which that trophic group depletes its resource(s). Our summary includes studies that have focused on the top-down effects of diversity, whereby researchers have examined how the richness of trophic group t impacts the consumption of a shared resource, and also studies that have focused on the bottom-up effects of diversity, whereby researchers have examined how the richness of trophic group t impacts consumption of t by the next highest trophic level. The first portion of the data set provides information about the source of data and relevant aspects of the experimental design, including the spatial and temporal scales at which the work was performed. The second portion gives the magnitude of each response variable, the standard deviation, and the level of replication at each level of species richness manipulated. The third portion of the data set summarizes the magnitude of diversity effects in two ways. First, log ratios are used to compare the response variable in the most diverse polyculture to either the mean of all monocultures or the species having the highest/lowest value in monoculture. Second, data from each level of species richness are fit to three nonlinear functions (log, power, and hyperbolic) to assess which best characterizes the shape of diversity effects. The final portion of the data set summarizes any information that helps parse diversity effects into that attributable to species richness vs. that attributable to changes in species composition across levels of richness.},

abstract = {The conventional representation of Plant Functional Types (PFTs) in Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) is increasingly recognized as simplistic and lacking in predictive power. Key ecophysiological traits, including photosynthetic parameters, are typically assigned single values for each PFT while the substantial trait variation within PFTs is neglected. This includes continuous variation in response to environmental factors, and differences linked to spatial and temporal niche differentiation within communities. A much stronger empirical basis is required for the treatment of continuous plant functional trait variation in DGVMs. We analyse 431 sets of measurements of leaf and plant traits, including photosynthetic measurements, on evergreen angiosperm trees in tropical moist forests of Australia and China. Confining attention to tropical moist forests, our analysis identifies trait differences that are linked to vegetation dynamic roles. Coordination theory predicts that Rubisco- and electron-transport limited rates of photosynthesis are co-limiting under field conditions. The least-cost hypothesis predicts that air-to-leaf CO2 drawdown minimizes the combined costs per unit carbon assimilation of maintaining carboxylation and transpiration capacities. Aspects of these predictions are supported for within-community trait variation linked to canopy position, just as they are for variation along spatial environmental gradients. Trait differences among plant species occupying different structural and temporal niches may provide a basis for the ecophysiological representation of vegetation dynamics in next-generation DGVMs.},

abstract = {Theory predicts a positive relationship between biodiversity and stability in ecosystem properties, while diversity is expected to have a negative impact on stability at the species level. We used virtual experiments based on a dynamic simulation model to test for the diversity-stability relationship and its underlying mechanisms in Central European forests. First our results show that variability in productivity between stands differing in species composition decreases as species richness and functional diversity increase. Second we show temporal stability increases with increasing diversity due to compensatory dynamics across species, supporting the biodiversity insurance hypothesis. We demonstrate that this pattern is mainly driven by the asynchrony of species responses to small disturbances rather than to environmental fluctuations, and is only weakly affected by the net biodiversity effect on productivity. Furthermore, our results suggest that compensatory dynamics between species may enhance ecosystem stability through an optimisation of canopy occupancy by coexisting species.},

abstract = {Understanding the recovery dynamics of ecosystems presents a major challenge in the human-impacted tropics. We tested whether secondary forests follow equilibrium or non-equilibrium dynamics by evaluating community reassembly over time, across different successional stages, and among multiple life stages. Based on long-term and static data from six 1-ha plots in NE Costa Rica, we show that secondary forests are undergoing reassembly of canopy tree and palm species composition through the successful recruitment of seedlings, saplings, and young trees of mature forest species. Such patterns were observed over time within sites and across successional stages. Floristic reassembly in secondary forests showed a clear convergence with mature forest community composition, supporting an equilibrium model. This resilience stems from three key factors co-occurring locally: high abundance of generalist species in the regional flora, high levels of seed dispersal, and local presence of old-growth forest remnants.},

We present a trait-based approach that provides an additive decomposition of species' trait values into alpha and beta components: beta values refer to a species' position along a gradient defined by community-level mean trait values; alpha values are the difference between a species' trait values and the mean of co-occurring taxa. In woody plant communities of coastal California, beta trait values for specific leaf area, leaf size, wood density and maximum height all covary strongly, reflecting species distributions across a gradient of soil moisture availability. Alpha values, on the other hand, are generally not significantly correlated, suggesting several independent axes of differentiation within communities. This trait-based framework provides a novel approach to integrate functional ecology and gradient analysis with community ecology and coexistence theory.},

Here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the "missing heritability" problem. GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets. {\textcopyright} 2011 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

abstract = {Synopsis Arnold's 1983 path-analytic paradigm, considering “morphology, performance, and fitness,” has been elabo- rated in several ways. For example, current versions recognize the level of “behavior” (including aspects of motivation) as a filter between performance abilities (only measurable if motivation is maximal) and fitness components. Performance abilities constrain behavior, but behavioral choices may shield performance from selection. Conceptual and empirical issues remain, such as the extent to which individual variation in lower-level subordinate traits (e.g., circulating hormone concentrations) might directly affect behavior, growth rates, sexual maturation, etc., rather than having effects only through paths involving some aspect of performance. Moreover, empirical studies have yet to encompass more than a few possible paths in a given system, in part because life-history researchers rarely communicate with those focused on performance. Most life-history studies ponder trade-offs associated with reproductive effort, but studies of locomotor performance (e.g., maximal sprint speed) have rarely considered trade-offs with reproduction. This lack of connection is surprising because both life history (e.g., clutch size) and locomotor performance (e.g., locomotor stamina) traits require allocation of energy and other resources, so trade-offs between these trait types may be expected. These perspectives and cultures could be bridged by a focus on the ability of organisms to perform components of reproductive biology (e.g., lactation performance could be studied in animals maximally “motivated” by manipulation of litter size or endocrine function). Alternatively, one could study impacts of reproduction on performance, as when bats and live-bearing fishes lose maneuverability during gestation. We also consider sperm performance in the context of the paradigm and illustrate that the paradigm can easily be utilized as a frame-work within which to consider key aspects of sperm biology.},

@article{Gerhold2015,
abstract = {1. The subdiscipline of 'community phylogenetics' is rapidly growing and influencing thinking regarding community assembly. In particular, phylogenetic dispersion of co-occurring species within a community is commonly used as a proxy to identify which community assembly pro-cesses may have structured a particular community: phylogenetic clustering as a proxy for abi-otic assembly, that is habitat filtering, and phylogenetic overdispersion as a proxy for biotic assembly, notably competition. 2. We challenge this approach by highlighting (typically) implicit assumptions that are, in reality, only weakly supported, including (i) phylogenetic dispersion reflects trait dispersion; (ii) a given ecological function can be performed only by a single trait state or combination of trait states; (iii) trait similarity causes enhanced competition; (iv) competition causes species exclusion; (v) commu-nities are at equilibrium with processes of assembly having been completed; (vi) assembly through habitat filtering decreases in importance if assembly through competition increases, such that the relative balance of the two can be thus quantified by a single parameter; and (vii) observed phylo-genetic dispersion is driven predominantly by local and present-day processes. 3. Moreover, technical sophistication of the phylogenetic-patterns-as-proxy approach trades off against sophistication in alternative, potentially more pertinent approaches to directly observe or manipulate assembly processes. 4. Despite concerns about using phylogenetic dispersion as a proxy for community assembly processes, we suggest there are underappreciated benefits of quantifying the phylogenetic structure of communities, including (i) understanding how coexistence leads to the macro-evolutionary diversification of habitat lineage-pools (i.e. phylogenetic-patterns-as-result approach); and (ii) understanding the macroevolutionary contingency of habitat lineage-pools and how it affects present-day species coexistence in local communities (i.e. phylogenetic-patterns-as-cause approach). 5. We conclude that phylogenetic patterns may be little useful as proxy of community assembly. However, such patterns can prove useful to identify and test novel hypotheses on (i) how local coexistence may control macroevolution of the habitat lineage-pool, for example through com-petition among close relatives triggering displacement and diversification of characters, and (ii) how macroevolution within the habitat lineage-pool may control local coexistence of related species, for example through origin of close relatives that can potentially enter in competition.},

abstract = {The African cichlid fish radiations are the most diverse extant animal radiations and provide a unique system to test predictions of speciation and adaptive radiation theory. The past few years have seen major advances in the phylogenetics, evolutionary biogeography and ecology of cichlid fish. Most of this work has concentrated on the most diverse radiations. Unfortunately, a large number of small radiations and 'non-radiations' have been overlooked, potentially limiting the contribution of the cichlid system to our understanding of speciation and adaptive radiation. I have reviewed the literature to identify 33 intralacustrine radiations and 76 failed radiations. For as many as possible I collected information on lake size, age and phylogenetic relationships. I use these data to address two questions: (i) whether the rate of speciation and the resulting species richness are related to temporal and spatial variation in ecological opportunity and (ii) whether the likelihood of undergoing adaptive radiation is similar for different African cichlid lineages. The former is a key prediction of the ecological theory of adaptive radiation that has been presumed true but remains untested for cichlid radiations. The second is based on the hypothesis that the propensity of cichlids to radiate is due to a key evolutionary innovation shared by all African cichlids. The evidence suggests that speciation rate declines through time as niches get filled up during adaptive radiation: young radiations and early stages of old radiations are characterized by high rates of speciation, whereas at least 0.5 Myr into a radiation speciation becomes a lot less frequent. The number of species in cichlid radiations increases with lake size, supporting the prediction that species diversity increases with habitat heterogeneity, but also with opportunity for isolation by distance. Finally, the data suggest that the propensity to radiate within lakes is a derived property that evolved during the evolutionary history of some African cichlids, and the appearance of which does not coincide with the appearance of proposed key innovations in morphology and life history. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Royal Society.},

Since its first release in 2004, SAGA has rapidly developed from a specialized tool for digital terrain analysis to a comprehensive and globally established GIS platform for scientific analysis and modeling. SAGA is coded in C++ in an object oriented design and runs under several operating systems including Windows and Linux. Key functional features of the modular software architecture comprise an application programming interface for the development and implementation of new geoscientific methods, a user friendly graphical user interface with many visualization options, a command line interpreter, and interfaces to interpreted languages like R and Python. The current version 2.1.4 offers more than 600 tools, which are implemented in dynamically loadable libraries or shared objects and represent the broad scopes of SAGA in numerous fields of geoscientific endeavor and beyond. In this paper, we inform about the system's architecture, functionality, and its current state of development and implementation. Furthermore, we highlight the wide spectrum of scientific applications of SAGA in a review of published studies, with special emphasis on the core application areas digital terrain analysis, geomorphology, soil science, climatology and meteorology, as well as remote sensing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Natural populations of forest trees exhibit striking phenotypic adaptations to diverse environmental gradients, thereby making them appealing subjects for the study of genes underlying ecologically relevant phenotypes. Here, we use a genome-wide data set of single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped across 3059 functional genes to study patterns of population structure and identify loci associated with aridity across the natural range of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.). Overall patterns of population structure, as inferred using principal components and Bayesian cluster analyses, were consistent with three genetic clusters likely resulting from expansions out of Pleistocene refugia located in Mexico and Florida. A novel application of association analysis, which removes the confounding effects of shared ancestry on correlations between genetic and environmental variation, identified five loci correlated with aridity. These loci were primarily involved with abiotic stress response to temperature and drought. A unique set of 24 loci was identified as FST outliers on the basis of the genetic clusters identified previously and after accounting for expansions out of Pleistocene refugia. These loci were involved with a diversity of physiological processes. Identification of nonoverlapping sets of loci highlights the fundamental differences implicit in the use of either method and suggests a pluralistic, yet complementary, approach to the identification of genes underlying ecologically relevant phenotypes.

abstract = {Aim: To better understand and more realistically predict future species distribution ranges, it is critical to account for local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in populations' responses to climate. This is challenging because local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are trait-dependent and traits covary along climatic gradients, with differential consequences for fitness. Our aim is to quantify local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity of vertical and radial growth, leaf flushing and survival across the range of Fagus sylvatica and to estimate the contribution of each trait to explaining the species' occurrence. Location: Europe. Time period: 1995–2014; 2070. Major taxa studied: Fagus sylvatica L. Methods: We used vertical and radial growth, flushing phenology and mortality of F. sylvatica L. recorded in the BeechCOSTe52 database ({\textgreater}150,000 trees). Firstly, we performed linear mixed-effect models that related trait variation and covariation to local adaptation (related to the planted populations' climatic origin) and phenotypic plasticity (accounting for the climate of the plantation), and we made spatial predictions under current and representative concentration pathway (RCP 8.5) climates. Secondly, we combined spatial trait predictions in a linear model to explain the occurrence of the species. Results: The contribution of plasticity to intraspecific trait variation is always higher than that of local adaptation, suggesting that the species is less sensitive to climate change than expected; different traits constrain beech's distribution in different parts of its range: the northernmost edge is mainly delimited by flushing phenology (mostly driven by photoperiod and temperature), the southern edge by mortality (mainly driven by intolerance to drought), and the eastern edge is characterized by decreasing radial growth (mainly shaped by precipitation-related variables in our model); considering trait covariation improved single-trait predictions. Main conclusions: Population responses to climate across large geographical gradients are dependent on trait × environment interactions, indicating that each trait responds differently depending on the local environment.},

abstract = {A species's niche width reflects a balance between the diversifying effects of intraspecific competition and the constraining effects of interspecific competition. This balance shifts when a species from a competitive environment invades a depauperate habitat where interspecific competition is reduced. The resulting ecological release permits population niche expansion, via increased individual niche widths and/or increased among-individual variation. We report an experimental test of the theory of ecological release in three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We factorially manipulated the presence or absence of two interspecific competitors: juvenile cut-throat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) and prickly sculpin (Cottus asper). Consistent with the classic niche variation hypothesis, release from trout competition increased stickleback population niche width via increased among-individual variation, while individual niche widths remained unchanged. In contrast, release from sculpin competition had no effect on population niche width, because increased individual niche widths were offset by decreased between-individual variation. Our results confirm that ecological release from interspecific competition can lead to increases in niche width, and that these changes can occur on behavioural time scales. Importantly, we find that changes in population niche width are decoupled from changes in the niche widths of individuals within the population.},

We included two types of stochasticity, namely, a random sampling effect of community founding and environmental fluctuation. Fluctuation was further divided into two categories: niche-independent fluctuation (synchronized over the niche space) and niche-dependent fluctuation (variable among individual niche positions). In the analysis, two types of genetic and inheritance systems of individual niche position were considered, i.e. sexual reproduction with multiple loci and asexual reproduction with phenotypic plasticity. We found that niche usage flexibility promoted species diversity only under restricted situations when the environment was constant, but it generally promoted diversity when the environment fluctuated. In particular, under niche-independent fluctuation, niche usage flexibility significantly enhanced species diversity. In contrast, the analysis also predicted that when niche flexibility was constant, species diversity decreased with increasing environmental correlation between neighboring niches.},

abstract = {When tropical systems lose species, they are often assumed to be buffered against declines in functional diversity by the ability of the species-rich biota to display high functional redundancy: i.e., a high number of species performing similar functions. We tested this hypothesis using a ninefold richness gradient in global fish faunas on tropical reefs encompassing 6,316 species distributed among 646 functional entities (FEs): i.e., unique combinations of functional traits. We found that the highest functional redundancy is located in the Central Indo-Pacific with a mean of 7.9 species per FE. However, this overall level of redundancy is disproportionately packed into few FEs, a pattern termed functional over-redundancy (FOR). For instance, the most speciose FE in the Central Indo-Pacific contains 222 species (out of 3,689) whereas 38{\%} of FEs (180 out of 468) have no functional insurance with only one species. Surprisingly, the level of FOR is consistent across the six fish faunas, meaning that, whatever the richness, over a third of the species may still be in overrepresented FEs whereas more than one third of the FEs are left without insurance, these levels all being significantly higher than expected by chance. Thus, our study shows that, even in high-diversity systems, such as tropical reefs, functional diversity remains highly vulnerable to species loss. Although further investigations are needed to specifically address the influence of redundant vs. vulnerable FEs on ecosystem functioning, our results suggest that the promised benefits from tropical biodiversity may not be as strong as previously thought.},

abstract = {Aim: To understand how variations in precipitation and topographic wetness influence tree community assembly at both regional and landscape scales in tropical forests. Location: New Caledonia (SW Pacific). Methods: We sampled 40 tree communities in 0.04-ha plots laid along topographic gradients within two landscapes with contrasting precipitation. Within a dry ({\textless}1,400 mm/year) and a wet ({\textgreater}2,500 mm/year) landscape we used the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) to sample communities in topographic position with low (e.g., ridges) and high (e.g., valleys) water accumulation. For each sampled species, we measured five functional traits involved in drought resistance and resource acquisition (wood density, leaf area, leaf specific area, leaf dry matter content, and leaf thickness). We first examined trait covariation across species. We then analysed how the functional composition of communities varied between landscapes (according to precipitation) and within landscapes (according to TWI), using trait-based statistics and null models. Results: We identified two ecological trade-offs driving trait variation across species: (i) one opposing high hydraulic efficiency to drought resistance, related to a wood economic spectrum; and (ii) the other opposing resource acquisition to resource conservation, related to a leaf economic spectrum. Across landscapes, species with drought resistance strategies were favoured at lower precipitation. Within landscapes, drought resistant species were selected under low TWI in the dry landscape, while low TWI increased the abundance of species with conservative strategies in the wet landscape. Conclusions: Precipitation and topography jointly shape the functional composition of tree communities. At low precipitation, hydric constraints prevailed on ridges and upslopes by filtering drought resistant strategies along the wood economic spectrum. Contrastingly, higher precipitation relaxed the hydric constraints and resource availability became a primary driver of changing strategies along the leaf economic spectrum. Thus, the landscape scale influence of topography on processes driving community assembly and functional composition critically depends on the regional climatic context.},

abstract = {Photosynthetic leaf traits were determined for savanna and forest ecosystems in West Africa, spanning a large range in precipitation. Standardized major axis fits revealed important differences between our data and reported global relationships. Especially for sites in the drier areas, plants showed higher photosynthetic rates for a given N or P when compared with relationships from the global data set. The best multiple regression for the pooled data set estimated V(cmax) and J(max) from N(DW) and S. However, the best regression for different vegetation types varied, suggesting that the scaling of photosynthesis with leaf traits changed with vegetation types. A new model is presented representing independent constraints by N and P on photosynthesis, which can be evaluated with or without interactions with S. It assumes that limitation of photosynthesis will result from the least abundant nutrient, thereby being less sensitive to the allocation of the non-limiting nutrient to non-photosynthetic pools. The model predicts an optimum proportionality for N and P, which is distinct for V(cmax) and J(max) and inversely proportional to S.

@article{Gompert2009,
abstract = {We propose a novel method that uses natural admixture between divergent lineages (hybridization) to investigate the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation and adaptive introgression. Our method employs multinomial regression to estimate genomic clines and to quantify introgression for individual loci relative to the genomic background (clines in genotype frequency along a genomic admixture gradient). Loci with patterns of introgression that deviate significantly from null expectations based on the remainder of the genome are potentially subject to selection and thus of interest to understanding adaptation and the evolution of reproductive isolation. Using simulations, we show that different forms of selection modify these genomic clines in predictable ways and that our method has good power to detect moderate to strong selection for multiple forms of selection. Using individual-based simulations, we demonstrate that our method generally has a low false positive rate, except when genetic drift is particularly pronounced (e.g. low population size, low migration rates from parental populations, and substantial time since initial admixture). Additional individual-based simulations reveal that moderate selection against heterozygotes can be detected as much as 50 cm away from the focal locus directly experiencing selection, but is not detected at unlinked loci. Finally, we apply our analytical method to previously published data sets from a mouse (Mus musculus and M. domesticus) and two sunflower (Helianthus petiolaris and H. annuus) hybrid zones. This method should be applicable to numerous species that are currently the focus of research in evolution and ecology and should help bring about new insights regarding the processes underlying the origin and maintenance of biological diversity.},

Here, we ask whether filtering of species at the local scale could be attributed to their hydraulic architectural traits, revealing the basis of hydrological microhabitat partitioning in a Central Amazonian forest. We analyzed the hydraulic characteristics at tissue (anatomical traits, wood specific gravity (WSG)), organ (leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area : sapwood area ratio) and whole-plant (height) levels for 28 pairs of congeneric species from 14 genera restricted to either valleys or plateaus of a terra-firme forest in Central Amazonia. On plateaus, species had higher WSG, but lower mean vessel area, mean vessel hydraulic diameter, sapwood area and SLA than in valleys; traits commonly associated with hydraulic safety. Mean vessel hydraulic diameter and mean vessel area increased with height for both habitats, but leaf area and leaf area : sapwood area ratio investments with tree height declined in valley vs plateau species. [Correction added after online publication 29 March 2017: the preceding sentence has been reworded.] Two strategies for either efficiency or safety were detected, based on vessel size or allocation to sapwood. In conclusion, contrasting hydrological conditions act as environmental filters, generating differences in species composition at the local scale. This has important implications for the prediction of species distributions under future climate change scenarios.},

abstract = {Through the lens of evolution, climate change is an agent of natural selection that forces populations to change and adapt, or face extinction. However, current assessments of the risk of biodiversity associated with climate change1 do not typically take into account how natural selection influences populations differently depending on their genetic makeup2. Here we make use of the extensive genome information that is available for Arabidopsis thaliana and measure how manipulation of the amount of rainfall affected the fitness of 517 natural Arabidopsis lines that were grown in Spain and Germany. This allowed us to directly infer selection along the genome3. Natural selection was particularly strong in the hot-dry location in Spain, where 63{\%} of lines were killed and where natural selection substantially changed the frequency of approximately 5{\%} of all genome-wide variants. A significant portion of this climate-driven natural selection of variants was predictable from signatures of local adaptation (R2 = 29–52{\%}), as genetic variants that were found in geographical areas with climates more similar to the experimental sites were positively selected. Field-validated predictions across the species range indicated that Mediterranean and western Siberian populations—at the edges of the environmental limits of this species—currently experience the strongest climate-driven selection. With more frequent droughts and rising temperatures in Europe4, we forecast an increase in directional natural selection moving northwards from the southern end of Europe, putting many native A. thaliana populations at evolutionary risk.},

abstract = {The quality of genome assemblies has improved rapidly in recent years due to continual advances in sequencing technology, assembly approaches, and quality control. In the field of molecular ecology, this has led to the development of exceptional quality genome assemblies that will be important long-term resources for broader studies into ecological, conservation, evolutionary, and population genomics of naturally occurring species. Moreover, the extent to which a single reference genome represents the diversity within a species varies: pan-genomes will become increasingly important ecological genomics resources, particularly in systems found to have considerable presence-absence variation in their functional content. Here, we highlight advances in technology that have raised the bar for genome assembly and provide guidance on standards to achieve exceptional quality reference genomes. Key recommendations include the following: (a) Genome assemblies should include long-read sequencing except in rare cases where it is effectively impossible to acquire adequately preserved samples needed for high molecular weight DNA standards. (b) At least one scaffolding approach should be included with genome assembly such as Hi-C or optical mapping. (c) Genome assemblies should be carefully evaluated, this may involve utilising short read data for genome polishing, error correction, k-mer analyses, and estimating the percent of reads that map back to an assembly. Finally, a genome assembly is most valuable if all data and methods are made publicly available and the utility of a genome for further studies is verified through examples. While these recommendations are based on current technology, we anticipate that future advances will push the field further and the molecular ecology community should continue to adopt new approaches that attain the highest quality genome assemblies.},

abstract = {Few facets of biology vary more than functional traits and life-history traits. To explore this vast variation, functional ecologists and population ecologists have developed independent approaches that identify the mechanisms behind and consequences of trait variation. Collaborative research between researchers using trait-based and demographic approaches remains scarce. We argue that this is a missed opportunity, as the strengths of both approaches could help boost the research agendas of functional ecology and population ecology. This special feature, which spans three journals of the British Ecological Society due to its interdisciplinary nature, showcases state-of-the-art research applying trait-based and demographic approaches to examine relationships between organismal function, life history strategies and population performance across multiple kingdoms. Examples include the exploration of how functional trait × environment interactions affect vital rates and thus explain population trends and species occurrence; the coordination of seed traits and dispersal ability with the pace of life in plants; the incorporation of functional traits in dynamic energy budget models; or the discovery of linkages between microbial functional traits and the fast–slow continuum. Despite their historical isolation, collaborative work between functional ecologists and population ecologists could unlock novel research pathways. We call for an integrative research agenda to evaluate which and when traits are functional, as well as their ability to describe and predict life history strategies and population dynamics. We highlight promising, complementary research avenues to overcome current limitations. These include a more explicit linkage of selection gradients in the context of functional trait–vital rate relationships, and the implementation of standardised protocols to track changes in traits and vital rates over time at the same location and individuals, thus allowing for the explicit incorporation of trade-offs in analyses of covariation of functional traits and life-history traits.},

abstract = {Regression dilution is a statistical inference bias that causes underestimation of the strength of dependency between two variables when the predictors are error-prone proxies (EPPs). EPPs are widely used in plant community studies focused on negative density-dependence (NDD) to quantify competitive interactions. Because of the nature of the bias, conspecific NDD is often overestimated in recruitment analyses, and in some cases, can be erroneously detected when absent. In contrast, for survival analyses, EPPs typically cause NDD to be underestimated, but underestimation is more severe for abundant species and for heterospecific effects, thereby generating spurious negative relationships between the strength of NDD and the abundances of con- and heterospecifics. This can explain why many studies observed rare species to suffer more severely from conspecific NDD, and heterospecific effects to be disproportionally smaller than conspecific effects. In general, such species-dependent bias is often related to traits associated with likely mechanisms of NDD, which creates false patterns and complicates the ecological interpretation of the analyses. Classic examples taken from literature and simulations demonstrate that this bias has been pervasive, which calls into question the emerging paradigm that intraspecific competition has been demonstrated by direct field measurements to be generally stronger than interspecific competition.},

abstract = {A conspicuous feature of natural communities is that individuals within species exhibit broad variation in their phenotype. While the phenotypic differences among species are prominent and have received considerable attention in earlier studies, recent findings suggest that about 40{\%} of the trait variation is found within species. How this intraspecific variation is related to underlying environmental gradients and ultimately linked to performance is an outstanding question in ecology and evolution. Here, we study six broadly distributed species across an elevational gradient in a subtropical forest. We focused on five functional traits reflecting plant functional differentiation in stem transport, leaf architecture, and leaf resource acquisition. We found that leaf thickness, leaf toughness, and specific leaf area generally varied with elevation, while wood density and leaf area exhibited constrained variation. Results on multivariate trait axes also showed mixed evidence with the PC1 values (positively related to leaf toughness and negatively related to specific leaf area) shifting with elevation, while PC2 values (negatively related to wood density) did not change with elevation. We also found that, despite the important variation in some traits along the gradient, growth performance did not follow this same trend. This suggests that strong directional changes in traits along the gradient may result in similar levels of demographic performance. The results, therefore, challenge the simple expectation that a trait will correlate with a demographic rate. More nuanced approaches and additional mechanisms must be considered to advance understanding of the performance–trait relationships.},

Central to the success of trees are their woody bodies, which connect their elevated photosynthetic canopies with the essential belowground activities of water and nutrient acquisition. The slow construction of these carbon-dense, woody skeletons leads to a slow generation time, leaving trees and forests highly susceptible to rapid changes in climate. Other long-lived, sessile organisms such as corals appear to be poorly equipped to survive rapid changes, which raises questions about the vulnerability of contemporary forests to future climate change. The emerging view that, similar to corals, tree species have rather inflexible damage thresholds, particularly in terms of water stress, is especially concerning.

abstract = {The functional trait composition of plant communities reflects the influence of ecological constraints on their assembly. In high-elevation peatlands of the Andes, multiple abiotic and biotic stresses are exerted on herbaceous plant communities. We hypothesized that dominant cushion-plant species found in these ecosystems strongly influence the dynamics of their subordinate plants by providing protection against external stress. To test the hypothesis, we addressed the variation of functional traits reflecting how subordinate plants invest in durable tissues and develop below and above the canopy of two cushion-plant species dominating the ecosystem, with varying intensity of herbivore pressure. We expected different functional composition of plants living below (understory stratum) and above (emergent stratum) the canopy, related to cushion-plant protection. In addition, we considered the functional composition of basic morphological guilds, forbs and graminoids, as they invest differently in plant development and respond differently to herbivore pressure. We found contrasted functional compositions among morphological guilds and according to the position relatively to cushion-plant canopy. These variations support a protective influence of cushion-plants on subordinate plants for both strata, with investment into less costly leaves and a larger stature when protection is greater, depending on cushion-plant species and cushion-plant height. External stress mainly affected emergent plants and led to different responses according to the guild. Graminoids showed avoidant strategy, while forbs shifted from avoidant to tolerant strategy with increasing herbivore pressure. Both between-species and intraspecific trait variations contributed to explain functional changes of guilds, but the relative contributions depended on morphological guild and stratum. A basic trade-off in physiological and morphological variability determined different relative contribution in forbs and graminoids. While functional ecology classically focuses on the composition of spatially delimited communities, we here underline the need to address separately the functional composition and assembly dynamics of distinct guilds making a community. In addition, our survey is the first to investigate the functional ecology of high-elevation tropical peatlands and provides novel insights into vegetation ecology in this stressful ecosystem.},

There is a near total lack of local differentiation in chloroplast DNA markers between them. A model is proposed to account for this lack of differentiation: inva- sion by one species of the range occupied by the other through pollen swamping. In support of this model, ecological, palaeoecological and population genetic studies indicate that one species ( Q. robur ) disperses its seeds better than the other one, that pollen flow is much more efficient than seed flow in oaks and that hybridization and introgression are asymmetric, hence reinforcing the ecological dynamics by facilitat- ing the dispersal of Q. petraea in regions already colonized by Q. robur . ‘Resurrec- tion' of Q. petraea following this wave of hybridization appears to be rapid. More generally, available evidence indicates that hybridization could constitute an impor- tant mechanism of dispersal in both natural and human-induced plant invasions.},

abstract = {Niche differentiation and ecological filtering are primary ecological processes that shape community assembly, but their relative importance remains poorly understood. Analyses of the distributions of functional traits can provide insight into the community structure generated by these processes. We predicted the trait distributions expected under the ecological processes of niche differentiation and environmental filtering, then tested these predictions with a dataset of 4672 trees located in nine 1-ha plots of tropical rain forest in French Guiana. Five traits related to leaf function (foliar N concentration, chlorophyll content, toughness, tissue density and specific leaf area), and three traits related to stem function (trunk sapwood density, branch sapwood density, and trunk bark thickness), as well as laminar surface area, were measured on every individual tree. There was far more evidence for environmental filtering than for niche differentiation in these forests. Furthermore, we contrasted results from species-mean and individual-level trait values. Analyses that took within-species trait variation into account were far more sensitive indicators of niche differentiation and ecological filtering. Species-mean analyses, by contrast, may underestimate the effects of ecological processes on community assembly. Environmental filtering appeared somewhat more intense on leaf traits than on stem traits, whereas niche differentiation affected neither strongly. By accounting for within-species trait variation, we were able to more properly consider the ecological interactions among individual trees and between individual trees and their environment. In so doing, our results suggest that the ecological processes of niche differentiation and environmental filtering may be more pervasive than previously believed.},

abstract = {The leaf economics spectrum (LES) describes large cross-species variation in suites of leaf functional traits ranging from resource-acquisitive to resource-conservative strategies. Such strategies have been integral in explaining plant adaptation to diverse environments, and have been linked to numerous ecosystem processes. The LES has previously been found to be significantly modulated by climate, soil fertility, biogeography, growth form, and life history. One largely unexplored aspect of LES variation, whole-plant ontogeny, is investigated here using multiple populations of three very different species of sunflower: Helianthus annuus, Helianthus mollis, and Helianthus radula. Plants were grown under environmentally controlled conditions and assessed for LES and related traits at four key developmental stages, using recently matured leaves to standardize for leaf age. Nearly every trait exhibited a significant ontogenetic shift in one or more species, with trait patterns differing among populations and species. Photosynthetic rate, leaf nitrogen concentration, and leaf mass per area exhibited surprisingly large changes, spanning over two-thirds of the original cross-species LES variation and shifting from resource-acquisitive to resource-conservative strategies as the plants matured. Other traits being investigated in relation to the LES, such as leaf water content, pH, and vein density, also showed large changes. The finding that ontogenetic variation in LES strategy can be substantial leads to a recommendation of standardization by developmental stage when assessing 'species values' of labile traits for comparative approaches. Additionally, the substantial ontogenetic trait shifts seen within single individuals provide an opportunity to uncover the contribution of gene regulatory changes to variation in LES traits. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author.},

abstract = {Aim Spatial modelling techniques are increasingly used in species distribution modelling. However, the implemented techniques differ in their modelling performance, and some consensus methods are needed to reduce the uncertainty of predictions. In this study, we tested the predictive accuracies of five consensus methods, namely Weighted Average (WA), Mean(All), Median(All), Median(PCA), and Best, for 28 threatened plant species. Location North-eastern Finland, Europe. Methods The spatial distributions of the plant species were forecasted using eight state-of-the-art single-modelling techniques providing an ensemble of predictions. The probability values of occurrence were then combined using five consensus algorithms. The predictive accuracies of the single-model and consensus methods were assessed by computing the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic plot. Results The mean AUC values varied between 0.697 (classification tree analysis) and 0.813 (random forest) for the single-models, and from 0.757 to 0.850 for the consensus methods. WA and Mean(All) consensus methods provided significantly more robust predictions than all the single-models and the other consensus methods. Main conclusions Consensus methods based on average function algorithms may increase significantly the accuracy of species distribution forecasts, and thus they show considerable promise for different conservation biological and biogeographical applications.},

abstract = {1. Light-saturated rate of photosynthesis (A(max)), nitrogen (N), chlorophyll (Chl) content and leaf mass per unit area (LMA) were measured in leaves of trees of different heights along a natural light gradient in a French Guiana rain forest. The following four species, arranged in order from most shade-tolerant to pioneer, were studied: Duguetia surinamensis, Vouacapoua americana, Dicorynia guianensis and Goupia glabra. Light availability of trees was estimated using hemispherical photography. 2. The pioneer species Goupia had the lowest LMA and leaf N on both an area and mass basis, whereas Duguetia had the highest values. In general, leaf variables of Vouacapoua and Dicorynia tended to be intermediates. Because A(max)/area was similar among species, Goupia showed both a much higher light-saturated photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUEmax) and A(max)/mass. Leaves of Vouacapoua demonstrated the greatest plasticity in A(max)/area, particularly in small saplings. 3. A distinction could be made between the effect of tree height and light availability on the structural, i.e. LMA, and photosynthetic leaf characteristics of all four species. The direction and magnitude of the variation in variables were similar among species. 4. LMA was the key variable that mainly determined variation in the other leaf variables along tree height and light availability gradients, with the exception of changes in chlorophyll concentration. A(max)/area, N/area, LMA and stomatal conductance to water vapour (g(s)) increased, whereas Chl/mass decreased, with both increasing tree height and canopy openness. A(max)/mass, PNUEmax and A(max)/Chl increased with increasing openness only. N/mass and Chl/area were independent of tree height and openness, except for small saplings of Goupia which had a much lower Chl/area},

abstract = {The intraspecific plant trait variability (ITV) is key for many ecological processes, but large-scale analysis of co-occurring species are rare. Here we studied ITV of 14 plant traits for five co-occurring species across 56 European dry grassland sites – large parts of the species distribution ranges. We evaluated variation in ITV relative to between species trait variability (BTV) with a particular emphasis on how within versus between population variability contributes to ITV. We performed this analysis trait by trait (univariate) and by considering hypervolumes in the multi-variate trait space. We also tested whether climatic variables can be used to predict between population variation in traits. For the trait by trait analysis, for 9 out of 14 traits ITV exceeded BTV, which suggests an extraordinary large role of ITV. However, when considering all traits jointly the hypervolume occupied by ITV was only 23{\%} of overall trait variability. We found comparatively small effects of within population variability in the uni- as well as in the multivariate analysis decreasing rapidly with increasing number of considered traits. The dominance of between population variability suggests that ITV is mainly driven by environmental effects rather than local biotic interactions and microsite effects. ITV of leaf chemical traits was related to precipitation and growing degree days until sampling ITV can be substantial compared to BTV, in particular when considering single traits, such that ITV should be considered in trait-based research. Since the importance of ITV appears to decrease when considering multiple traits jointly, using species mean trait values is more appropriate for multi-variate trait analysis. Because ITV varied mainly between populations rather than within populations, and was related to climatic conditions, we suggest that ITV could be accounted for in future trait based research by including environmental covariates in hierarchical models of trait variation},

abstract = {1. As species are often considered discrete natural units, interspecific sexual interactions are often disregarded as potential factors determining community composition. Nevertheless reproductive interference, ranging from signal jamming to hybridization, can have significant costs for species sharing similar signal channels. 2. We combined laboratory and field experiments to test whether the coexistence of two congeneric ground-hopper species with overlapping ranges might be influenced by sexual interactions. 3. In the laboratory experiment the number of conspecific copulations of Tetrix ceperoi decreased substantially in the presence of Tetrix subulata. Males of T. ceperoi performed more mating attempts with heterospecific females, whereas females of T. subulata rejected these heterospecific approaches more often than those of conspecifics. Although no heterospecific matings occurred in the laboratory, the reproductive success of T. ceperoi was reduced substantially in field experiments. Negative effects on T. subulata were found only at high densities. 4. Our results suggest that reproductive interference could have similar consequences as competition, such as demographic displacement of one species ('sexual exclusion'). As reproductive interference should be selected against, it may also drive the evolution of signals (reproductive character displacement) or promote habitat, spatial or temporal segregation. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

@article{Guisan2019,
abstract = {Issue: Approaches to predicting species assemblages through stacking individual niche-based species distribution models (S-SDMs) need to account for community processes other than abiotic filtering. Such constraints have been introduced by implementing ecological assembly rules (EARs) into S-SDMs, and can be based on patterns of functional traits in communities. Despite being logically valid, this approach has led to a limited improvement in prediction, possibly because of mismatches between the scales of measurement of niche and trait data. Evidence: S-SDM studies have often related single values of a species' traits to environmental niches that are captured by abiotic conditions measured at a much finer spatial scale, without accounting for intraspecific trait variation along environmental gradients. Many pieces of evidence show that omitting intraspecific trait variation can hinder the proper inference of EARs from trait patterns, and we further argue that it can therefore also affect our capacity to spatially predict functional properties of communities. In addition, estimates of environmental niches and trait envelopes may vary depending on the scale at which environmental and trait measurements are made. Conclusion: We suggest that to overcome these limitations, surveys sampling both niche and trait measurements should be conducted at fine scales along wide environmental gradients, and integrated at the same scale to test and improve a new generation of spatial community models and their functional properties.},

abstract = {Abstract Disentangling the relative roles of biotic and abiotic forces influencing forest structure, function, and local community composition continues to be an important goal in ecology. Here, utilizing two forest surveys 20-year apart from a Central American dry tropical forest, we assess the relative role of past disturbance and local climatic change in the form of increased drought in driving forest dynamics. We observe: (i) a net decrease in the number of trees; (ii) a decrease in total forest biomass by 7.7-{\'{a}}Mg-{\'{a}}haG{\^{e}}{\AE}1 but when calculated on subquadrat basis the biomass per unit area did not change indicating scale sensitivity of forest biomass measures; (iii) that the decrease in the number of stems occurred mainly in the smallest sizes, and in more moist and evergreen habitats; (iv) that there has been an increase in the proportion of trees that are deciduous, compound leaved and are canopy species, and a concomitant reduction in trees that are evergreen, simple-leaved, and understory species. These changes are opposite to predictions based on recovery from disturbance, and have resulted in (v) a uniform multivariate shift from a more mesic to a more xeric forest. Together, our results show that over relatively short time scales, community composition and the functional dominance may be more responsive to climate change than recovery to past disturbances. Our findings point to the importance of assessing proportional changes in forest composition and not just changes in absolute numbers. Our findings are also consistent with the hypothesis that tropical tree species exhibit differential sensitivity to changes in precipitation. Predicted future decreases in rainfall may result in quick differential shifts in forest function, physiognomy, and species composition. Quantifying proportional functional composition offers a basis for a predictive framework for how the structure, and diversity of tropical forests will respond to global change},

abstract = {• Premise of the study: Leaves at the tops of most trees are smaller, thicker, and in many other ways different from leaves on the lowermost branches. This height-related variation in leaf structure has been explained as acclimation to differing light environments and, alternatively, as a consequence of hydrostatic, gravitational constraints on turgor pressure that reduce leaf expansion. • Methods: To separate hydrostatic effects from those of light availability, we used anatomical analysis of height-paired samples from the inner and outer tree crowns of tall redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens). • Key results: Height above the ground correlates much more strongly with leaf anatomy than does light availability. Leaf length, width, and mesophyll porosity all decrease linearly with height and help explain increases in leaf-mass-to-area ratio and decreases in both photosynthetic capacity and internal gas-phase conductance with increasing height. Two functional traits-leaf thickness and transfusion tissue-also increase with height and may improve water-stress tolerance. Transfusion tissue area increases enough that whole-leaf vascular volume does not change significantly with height in most trees. Transfusion tracheids become deformed with height, suggesting they may collapse under water stress and act as a hydraulic buffer that improves leaf water status and reduces the likelihood of xylem dysfunction. • Conclusions: That such variation in leaf structure may be caused more by gravity than by light calls into question use of the terms "sun" and "shade" to describe leaves at the tops and bottoms of tall tree crowns.},

abstract = {The diversity of life is ultimately generated by evolution, and much attention has focused on the rapid evolution of ecological traits. Yet, the tendency for many ecological traits to instead remain similar over time [niche conservatism (NC)] has many consequences for the fundamental patterns and processes studied in ecology and conservation biology. Here, we describe the mounting evidence for the importance of NC to major topics in ecology (e.g. species richness, ecosystem function) and conservation (e.g. climate change, invasive species). We also review other areas where it may be important but has generally been overlooked, in both ecology (e.g. food webs, disease ecology, mutualistic interactions) and conservation (e.g. habitat modification). We summarize methods for testing for NC, and suggest that a commonly used and advocated method (involving a test for phylogenetic signal) is potentially problematic, and describe alternative approaches. We suggest that considering NC: (1) focuses attention on the within-species processes that cause traits to be conserved over time, (2) emphasizes connections between questions and research areas that are not obviously related (e.g. invasives, global warming, tropical richness), and (3) suggests new areas for research (e.g. why are some clades largely nocturnal? why do related species share diseases?). {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Functional trait databases are powerful tools in ecology, though most of them contain large amounts of missing values. The goal of this study was to test the effect of imputation methods on the evaluation of trait values at species level and on the subsequent calculation of functional diversity indices at community level using functional trait databases. Two simple imputation methods (average and median), two methods based on ecological hypotheses, and one multiple imputation method were tested using a large plant trait database, together with the influence of the percentage of missing data and differences between functional traits. At community level, the complete-case approach and three functional diversity indices calculated from grassland plant communities were included. At the species level, one of the methods based on ecological hypothesis was for all traits more accurate than imputation with average or median values, but the multiple imputation method was superior for most of the traits. The method based on functional proximity between species was the best method for traits with an unbalanced distribution, while the method based on the existence of relationships between traits was the best for traits with a balanced distribution. The ranking of the grassland communities for their functional diversity indices was not robust with the complete-case approach, even for low percentages of missing data. With the imputation methods based on ecological hypotheses, functional diversity indices could be computed with a maximum of 30{\%} of missing data, without affecting the ranking between grassland communities. The multiple imputation method performed well, but not better than single imputation based on ecological hypothesis and adapted to the distribution of the trait values for the functional identity and range of the communities. Ecological studies using functional trait databases have to deal with missing data using imputation methods corresponding to their specific needs and making the most out of the information available in the databases. Within this framework, this study indicates the possibilities and limits of single imputation methods based on ecological hypothesis and concludes that they could be useful when studying the ranking of communities for their functional diversity indices.},

abstract = {* 1Tropical rain forest tree species are commonly perceived to have more generalized habitat distributions than understorey species. However, the correspondence between floristic patterns in large trees and smaller understorey plants in relation to environmental differences has rarely been investigated. Comparative analyses are complicated by the fact that tree data are often much more noisy, with higher overall species richness and poorer spatial and temporal representation of species composition within sampling plots.
* 2Using data on trees and pteridophytes collected in 1125 plots located within 6 km2 of lowland rain forest in Costa Rica, we asked: (i) Is there evidence that trees are more generalized in their edaphic and topographic distributions than pteridophytes, and (ii) How much might differences in sampling efficiency affect the results?
* 3We ran community-level analyses using Mantel tests, and for the five most frequent tree and pteridophyte species we ran logistic regression analyses of species occurrence. To investigate the influence of differing sampling efficiency, the analyses were repeated with four rarefied pteridophyte data sets approximating key structural features of the tree data set.
* 4Differences in community composition in trees and in all pteridophyte data sets were most strongly correlated with environmental differences in the same five soil variables. The most frequent species in both plant groups had non-random edaphic and topographic distributions.
* 5Both Mantel correlations and the predictive performance of single species models (AUC values) were higher for the full pteridophyte data set than for trees, but these differences were much reduced after pteridophyte rarefaction.
* 6The performance of the species occurrence models calibrated with rarefied pteridophyte data appeared poor when tested on rarefied data. However, their performance in predicting occurrences in the full data set was usually moderate (AUC {\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} 0.70). This suggests that the tree species models may also predict species' potential habitat distributions better than is apparent from their AUC values.
* 7Synthesis. Our results indicate that rain forest trees and pteridophytes may respond to mesoscale environmental variation in qualitatively similar ways, but that trees will appear much more generalized in their response to the environment unless differences in sampling efficiency are taken into account.},

abstract = {Old-growth forest ecosystems comprise a mosaic of patches in different successional stages, with the fraction of the landscape in any particular state relatively constant over large temporal and spatial scales. The size distribution and return frequency of disturbance events, and subsequent recovery processes, determine to a large extent the spatial scale over which this old-growth steady state develops. Here, we characterize this mosaic for a Central Amazon forest by integrating field plot data, remote sensing disturbance probability distribution functions, and individual-based simulation modeling. Results demonstrate that a steady state of patches of varying successional age occurs over a relatively large spatial scale, with important implications for detecting temporal trends on plots that sample a small fraction of the landscape. Long highly significant stochastic runs averaging 1.0 Mg biomass{\textperiodcentered}ha-1{\textperiodcentered}y-1 were often punctuated by episodic disturbance events, resulting in a saw tooth time series of hectare-scale tree biomass. To maximize the detection of temporal trends for this Central Amazon site (e.g., driven by CO2 fertilization), plots larger than 10 ha would provide the greatest sensitivity. A model-based analysis of fractional mortality across all gap sizes demonstrated that 9.1-16.9{\%} of tree mortality was missing from plot-based approaches, underscoring the need to combine plot and remote-sensing methods for estimating net landscape carbon balance. Old-growth tropical forests can exhibit complex large-scale structure driven by disturbance and recovery cycles, with ecosystem and community attributes of hectare-scale plots exhibiting continuous dynamic departures from a steady-state condition.},

Whether nutrient patches maintain consistency (no change in ranking through sequential sampling), through temporal scales, and whether topography and litterfall contribute to the persistence of such ranking is rarely tested. Methods: In a 1-ha tropical rainforest plot in Southwest China, we measured soil pH, total N, NH4–N, NO3–N, and available P and K for four times and assessed the patch structure (patterns of patch distribution) and their temporal consistency. We then tested how structure and consistency of chemical soil properties were affected by topography and chemical inputs from litterfall. Results: All soil chemical properties showed significant seasonal fluctuations, but patch consistency was higher for soil pH, total N, and available P and K compared to NH4–N or NO3–N. Topography influenced pH patch consistency while annual litterfall input was important for maintaining patch consistency in total N and available P and K. Conclusions: Fine-scale consistency of patches in soil pH, total N, and available P and K suggest they may exert stable selection pressures on species for niche differentiation, while consistency of soil NH4–N and NO3–N require further study.},

Applying whole-transcriptome sequencing and population genetic analyses, we present an example of ancient introgression from a cypress species (Cupressus gigantea) that occurs at higher latitude and elevation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau into a related species (C. duclouxiana), which has likely aided the latter species to extend its range by colonizing cooler and drier mountain habitats during postglacial periods. We show that 16 introgressed candidate adaptive loci could have played pivotal roles in response to diverse stresses experienced in a high-elevation environment. Our findings provide new insights into the evolutionary history of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau plants and the importance of introgression in the adaptation of species to climate change.},

abstract = {Understanding the role of biodiversity (B) in maintaining ecosystem function (EF) is a foundational scientific goal with applications for resource management and conservation. Two main hypotheses have emerged that address B–EF relationships: niche complementarity (NC) and the mass-ratio (MR) effect. We tested the rela- tive importance of these hypotheses in a subtropical old- growth forest on the island nation of Taiwan for two EFs: aboveground biomass (ABG) and coarse woody produc- tivity (CWP). Functional dispersion (FDis) of eight plant functional traits was used to evaluate complementarity of resource use. Under the NC hypothesis, EF will be posi- tively correlated with FDis. Under the MR hypothesis, EF will be negatively correlated with FDis and will be signifi- cantly influenced by community-weighted mean (CWM) trait values. We used path analysis to assess how these two processes (NC and MR) directly influence EF and may contribute indirectly to EF via their influence on canopy packing (stem density). Our results indicate that decreas- ing functional diversity and a significant influence of CWM traits were linked to increasing AGB for all eight traits in this forest supporting the MR hypothesis. Interestingly, CWP was primarily influenced by NC and MR indirectly via their influence on canopy packing. Maximum height explained more of the variation in both AGB and CWP than any of the other plant functional traits. Together, our results suggest that multiple mechanisms operate simultaneously to influence EF, and understanding their relative impor- tance will help to elucidate the role of biodiversity in main- taining ecosystem function.},

abstract = {A convincing body of evidence shows that as it is presently codified, sustainable forest-management (SFM) logging implemented at an industrial scale guarantees commercial and biological depletion of high-value timber species within three harvests in all three major tropical forest regions. The minimum technical standards necessary for approaching ecological sustainability directly contravene the prospects for financial profitability. Therefore, industrial-scale SFM is likely to lead to the degradation and devaluation of primary tropical forests as surely as widespread conventional unmanaged logging does today. Recent studies also show that logging in the tropics, even using SFM techniques, releases significant carbon dioxide and that carbon stocks once stored in logged timber and slash takes decades to rebuild. These results beg for a reevaluation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change proposals to apply a Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation subsidy for the w...},

abstract = {Wood density is considered as one of the most important wood properties which affects the properties and value of both fibrous and solid wood products. The present study was intended for evaluating the possibilities of improving wood quality and growth of poplar hybrids. Wood density components of individual growth rings (minimum and maximum wood density, average ring density) and growth traits (tree height, dbh, stem volume) were measured in four 10- and 12-year-old clonal trials of four poplar hybrids, Populus deltoides ?? P. nigra, P. trichocarpa ?? P. deltoides, P. maximowiczii ?? P. balsamifera, and P. balsamifera ?? P. nigra, as well as P. deltoides. Wood density components of individual growth rings were obtained from microdensitometeric profiles measured with a direct reading X-ray densitometer. Site had a moderately significant effect on wood density and a highly significant effect on tree growth. The hybrid effect was highly significant (P {\textless} 0.001) for most traits. Minimum, maximum and weighted wood densities were found to be under strong genetic control, with clonal repeatabilities varying between 0.45 and 0.81. The coefficient of genotypic variation (CVG) for wood density at individual sites ranged from 4.0 to 6.8{\%}, whereas CVG for dry fiber weight (mass) reached 32.8{\%} with repeatabilities of up to 0.67. A small but significant (P = 0.028) hybrid ?? environment interaction was found for dry fiber weight. The highest ecological sensitivity was found for P. deltoides ?? P. nigra, with ecovalence reaching 32.3{\%}. Clonal ?? environment interaction was significant for weighted, average, and minimum wood density. Significant negative genotypic correlations between stem volume and wood density ranged from -0.39 to -0.74. One possible strategy in tree breeding would be to maximize wood fiber production through selection for dry fiber weight. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {More than 500 controlled experiments have collectively suggested that biodiversity loss reduces ecosystem productivity and stability 1-3. Yet the importance of biodiversity in sustaining the world's ecosystems remains controversial 4-8 , largely because of the lack of validation in nature, where strong abiotic forcing and complex interactions are assumed to swamp biodiversity effects 6-9. Here we test this assumption by analysing 133 estimates reported in 67 field studies that statistically separated the effects of biodiversity on biomass production from those of abiotic forcing. Contrary to the prevailing opinion of the previous two decades that biodiversity would have rare or weak effects in nature, we show that biomass production increases with species richness in a wide range of wild taxa and ecosystems. In fact, after controlling for environmental covariates, increases in biomass with biodiversity are stronger in nature than has previously been documented in experiments and comparable to or stronger than the effects of other well-known drivers of productivity, including climate and nutrient availability. These results are consistent with the collective experimental evidence that species richness increases community biomass production, and suggest that the role of biodiversity in maintaining productive ecosystems should figure prominently in global change science and policy.},

abstract = {DNA polymorphism at 22 loci was studied in an average of 47 Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] haplotypes sampled in seven populations representative of the natural range. The overall nucleotide variation was limited, being lower than that observed in most plant species so far studied. Linkage disequilibrium was also restricted and did not extend beyond a few hundred base pairs. All populations, with the exception of the Romanian population, could be divided into two main domains, a Baltico-Nordic and an Alpine one. Mean Tajima's D and Fay and Wu's H across loci were both negative, indicating the presence of an excess of both rare and high-frequency-derived variants compared to the expected frequency spectrum in a standard neutral model. Multilocus neutrality tests based on D and H led to the rejection of the standard neutral model and exponential growth in the whole population as well as in the two main domains. On the other hand, in all three cases the data are compatible with a severe bottleneck occurring some hundreds of thousands of years ago. Hence, demographic departures from equilibrium expectations and population structure will have to be accounted for when detecting selection at candidate genes and in association mapping studies, respectively.

abstract = {Ecophylogenetics can be viewed as an emerging fusion of ecology, biogeography and macroevolution. This new and fast-growing field is promoting the incorporation of evolution and historical contingencies into the ecological research agenda through the widespread use of phylogenetic data. Including phylogeny into ecological thinking represents an opportunity for biologists from different fields to collaborate and has provided promising avenues of research in both theoretical and empirical ecology, towards a better understanding of the assembly of communities, the functioning of ecosystems and their responses to environmental changes. The time is ripe to assess critically the extent to which the integration of phylogeny into these different fields of ecology has delivered on its promise. Here we review how phylogenetic information has been used to identify better the key components of species interactions with their biotic and abiotic environments, to determine the relationships between diversity and ecosystem functioning and ultimately to establish good management practices to protect overall biodiversity in the face of global change. We evaluate the relevance of information provided by phylogenies to ecologists, highlighting current potential weaknesses and needs for future developments. We suggest that despite the strong progress that has been made, a consistent unified framework is still missing to link local ecological dynamics to macroevolution. This is a necessary step in order to interpret observed phylogenetic patterns in a wider ecological context. Beyond the fundamental question of how evolutionary history contributes to shape communities, ecophylogenetics will help ecology to become a better integrative and predictive science.},

abstract = {A life-history trade-off between low mortality in the dark and rapid growth in the light is one of the most widely accepted mechanisms underlying plant ecological strategies in tropical forests. Differences in plant functional traits are thought to underlie these distinct ecological strategies; however, very few studies have shown relationships between functional traits and demographic rates within a functional group. We present 8years of growth and mortality data from saplings of 15 species of Dipterocarpaceae planted into logged-over forest in Malaysian Borneo, and the relationships between these demographic rates and four key functional traits: wood density, specific leaf area (SLA), seed mass, and leaf C:N ratio. Species-specific differences in growth rates were separated from seedling size effects by fitting nonlinear mixed-effects models, to repeated measurements taken on individuals at multiple time points. Mortality data were analyzed using binary logistic regressions in a mixed-effects models framework. Growth increased and mortality decreased with increasing light availability. Species differed in both their growth and mortality rates, yet there was little evidence for a statistical interaction between species and light for either response. There was a positive relationship between growth rate and the predicted probability of mortality regardless of light environment, suggesting that this relationship may be driven by a general trade-off between traits that maximize growth and traits that minimize mortality, rather than through differential species responses to light. Our results indicate that wood density is an important trait that indicates both the ability of species to grow and resistance to mortality, but no other trait was correlated with either growth or mortality. Therefore, the growth mortality trade-off among species of dipterocarp appears to be general in being independent of species crossovers in performance in different light environments.},

abstract = {Estimating the evolutionary potential of quantitative traits and reliably predicting responses to selection in wild populations are important challenges in evolutionary biology. The genomic revolution has opened up opportunities for measuring relatedness among individuals with precision, enabling pedigree-free estimation of trait heritabilities in wild populations. However, until now, most quantitative genetic studies based on a genomic relatedness matrix (GRM) have focused on long-term monitored populations for which traditional pedigrees were also available, and have often had access to knowledge of genome sequence and variability. Here, we investigated the potential of RAD-sequencing for estimating heritability in a free-ranging roe deer (Capreolous capreolus) population for which no prior genomic resources were available. We propose a step-by-step analytical framework to optimize the quality and quantity of the genomic data and explore the impact of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling and filtering processes on the GRM structure and GRM-based heritability estimates. As expected, our results show that sequence coverage strongly affects the number of recovered loci, the genotyping error rate and the amount of missing data. Ultimately, this had little effect on heritability estimates and their standard errors, provided that the GRM was built from a minimum number of loci (above 7,000). Genomic relatedness matrix-based heritability estimates thus appear robust to a moderate level of genotyping errors in the SNP data set. We also showed that quality filters, such as the removal of low-frequency variants, affect the relatedness structure of the GRM, generating lower h2 estimates. Our work illustrates the huge potential of RAD-sequencing for estimating GRM-based heritability in virtually any natural population.},

abstract = {Many aspects of the historical relationships between populations in a species are reflected in genetic data. Inferring these relationships from genetic data, however, remains a challenging task. In this paper, we present a statistical model for inferring the patterns of population splits and mixtures in multiple populations. In our model, the sampled populations in a species are related to their common ancestor through a graph of ancestral populations. Using genome-wide allele frequency data and a Gaussian approximation to genetic drift, we infer the structure of this graph. We applied this method to a set of 55 human populations and a set of 82 dog breeds and wild canids. In both species, we show that a simple bifurcating tree does not fully describe the data; in contrast, we infer many migration events. While some of the migration events that we find have been detected previously, many have not. For example, in the human data, we infer that Cambodians trace approximately 16{\%} of their ancestry to a population ancestral to other extant East Asian populations. In the dog data, we infer that both the boxer and basenji trace a considerable fraction of their ancestry (9{\%} and 25{\%}, respectively) to wolves subsequent to domestication and that East Asian toy breeds (the Shih Tzu and the Pekingese) result from admixture between modern toy breeds and "ancient" Asian breeds.

In this new view it is important to understand the conditions under which 'divergence hitchhiking' associated with the physical linkage of gene regions, versus 'genome hitchhiking' associated with reductions in genome-wide rates of gene flow caused by selection, can enhance speciation-with-gene-flow. We describe here a theory predicting four phases of speciation, defined by changes in the relative effectiveness of divergence and genome hitchhiking, and review empirical data in light of the theory. We outline future directions, emphasizing the need to couple next-generation sequencing with selection, transplant, functional genomics, and mapping studies.

abstract = {Ecological communities and their response to environmental gradients are increasingly being described by various measures of trait composition. Aggregated trait averages (i.e. averages of trait values of constituent species, weighted by species proportions) are popular indices reflecting the functional characteristics of locally dominant species. Because the variation of these indices along environmental gradients can be caused by both species turnover and intraspecific trait variability, it is necessary to disentangle the role of both components to community variability. For quantitative traits, trait averages can be calculated from ‘fixed' trait values (i.e. a single mean trait value for individual species used for all habitats where the species is found) or trait values for individual species specific to each plot, or habitat, where the species is found. Changes in fixed averages across environments reflect species turnover, while changes in specific traits reflect both species turnover and within-species variability in traits. Here we suggest a practical method (accompanied by a set of R functions) that, by combining ‘fixed' and ‘specific averages', disentangles the effect of species turnover, intraspecific trait variability, and their covariation. These effects can be further decomposed into parts ascribed to individual explanatory variables (i.e. treatments or environmental gradients considered). The method is illustrated with a case study from a factorial mowing and fertilization experiment in a meadow in South Bohemia. Results show that the variability decomposition differs markedly among traits studied (height, Specific Leaf Area, Leaf N, P, C concentrations, leaf and stem dry matter content), both according to the relative importance of species turnover and intraspecific variability, and also according to their response to experimental factors. Both the effect of intraspecific trait variability and species turnover must be taken into account when assessing the functional role of community trait structure. Neglecting intraspecific trait variability across habitats often results in underestimating the response of communities to environmental changes.},

abstract = {Background and Aims When ecologically important plant traits are correlated they may be said to constitute an ecological ‘strategy' dimension. Through identifying these dimensions and understanding their inter-relationships we gain insight into why particular trait combinations are favoured over others and into the implications of trait differences among species. Here we investigated relationships among several traits, and thus the strategy dimensions they represented, across 2134 woody species from seven Neotropical forests. Methods Six traits were studied: specific leaf area (SLA), the average size of leaves, seed and fruit, typical maximum plant height, and wood density (WD). Trait relationships were quantified across species at each individual forest as well as across the dataset as a whole. ‘Phylogenetic' analyses were used to test for correlations among evolutionary trait-divergences and to ascertain whether interspecific relationships were biased by strong taxonomic patterning in the traits. Key Results The interspecific and phylogenetic analyses yielded congruent results. Seed and fruit size were expected, and confirmed, to be tightly related. As expected, plant height was correlated with each of seed and fruit size, albeit weakly. Weak support was found for an expected positive relationship between leaf and fruit size. The prediction that SLA and WD would be negatively correlated was not supported. Otherwise the traits were predicted to be largely unrelated, being representatives of putatively independent strategy dimensions. This was indeed the case, although WD was consistently, negatively related to leaf size. Conclusions The dimensions represented by SLA, seed/fruit size and leaf size were essentially independent and thus conveyed largely independent information about plant strategies. To a lesser extent the same was true for plant height and WD. Our tentative explanation for negative WD–leaf size relationships, now also known from other habitats, is that the traits are indirectly linked via plant hydraulics.},

abstract = {* • Shade tolerance is the central paradigm for understanding forest succession and dynamics, but there is considerable debate as to what the salient features of shade tolerance are, whether adult leaves show similar shade adaptations to seedling leaves, and whether the same leaf adaptations are found in forests under different climatic control.
* • Here, adult leaf and metamer traits were measured for 39 tree species from a tropical moist semi-evergreen forest (1580 mm rain yr−1) and 41 species from a dry deciduous forest (1160 mm yr−1) in Bolivia. Twenty-six functional traits were measured and related to species regeneration light requirements.
* • Adult leaf traits were clearly associated with shade tolerance. Different, rather than stronger, shade adaptations were found for moist compared with dry forest species. Shade adaptations exclusively found in the evergreen moist forest were related to tough and persistent leaves, and shade adaptations in the dry deciduous forest were related to high light interception and water use.
* • These results suggest that, for forests differing in rainfall seasonality, there is a shift in the relative importance of functional leaf traits and performance trade-offs that control light partitioning. In the moist evergreen forest leaf traits underlying the growth–survival trade-off are important, whereas in the seasonally deciduous forest leaf traits underlying the growth trade-off between low and high light might become important.},

abstract = {Given the disposability of somatic tissue, selection can favor a higher mutation rate in the early segregating soma than in germline, as seen in some animals. Although in plants intra-organismic mutation rate heterogeneity is poorly resolved, the same selectionist logic can predict a lower rate in shoot than in root and in longer-lived terminal tissues (e.g., leaves) than in ontogenetically similar short-lived ones (e.g., petals), and that mutation rate heterogeneity should be deterministic with no significant differences between biological replicates. To address these expectations, we sequenced 754 genomes from various tissues of eight plant species. Consistent with a selectionist model, the rate of mutation accumulation per unit time in shoot apical meristem is lower than that in root apical tissues in perennials, in which a high proportion of mutations in shoots are themselves transmissible, but not in annuals, in which somatic mutations tend not to be transmissible. Similarly, the number of mutations accumulated in leaves is commonly lower than that within a petal of the same plant, and there is no more heterogeneity in accumulation rates between replicate branches than expected by chance. High mutation accumulation in runners of strawberry is, we argue, the exception that proves the rule, as mutation transmission patterns indicate that runner has a restricted germline. However, we also find that in vitro callus tissue has a higher mutation rate (per unit time) than the wild-grown comparator, suggesting nonadaptive mutational “fragility”. As mutational fragility does not obviously explain why the shoot—root difference varies with plant longevity, we conclude that some mutation rate variation between tissues is consistent with selectionist theory but that a mechanistic null of mutational fragility should be considered.},

abstract = {The distribution of intraspecific genetic variation and how it relates to environmental factors is of increasing interest to researchers in macroecology and biogeography. Recent studies investigated the relationships between the environment and patterns of intraspecific genetic variation across species ranges but only few rigorously tested the relation between genetic groups and their ecological niches. We quantified the relationship of genetic differentiation (FST) and the overlap of ecological niches (as measured by n-dimensional hypervolumes) among genetic groups resulting from spatial Bayesian genetic clustering in the wolf (Canis lupus) in the Italian peninsula. Within the Italian wolf population, four genetic clusters were detected, and these clusters showed different ecological niches. Moreover, different wolf clusters were significantly related to differences in land cover and human disturbance features. Such differences in the ecological niches of genetic clusters should be interpreted in light of neutral processes that hinder movement, dispersal, and gene flow among the genetic clusters, in order to not prematurely assume any selective or adaptive processes. In the present study, we found that both the plasticity of wolves—a habitat generalist—to cope with different environmental conditions and the occurrence of barriers that limit gene flow lead to the formation of genetic intraspecific genetic clusters and their distinct ecological niches.},

It is thus desirable to simplify the workflow for high-throughput diagnostics. Fragmentation of DNA is a crucial step for preparation of template libraries and various methods are currently known. Here we evaluated the performance of nebulization, sonication and random enzymatic digestion of long-range PCR products on the results of NGS. All three methods produced high-quality sequencing libraries for the 454 platform. However, if long-range PCR products of different length were pooled equimolarly, sequence coverage drastically dropped for fragments below 3,000 bp. All three methods performed equally well with regard to overall sequence quality (PHRED) and read length. Enzymatic fragmentation showed highest consistency between three library preparations but performed slightly worse than sonication and nebulization with regard to insertions/deletions in the raw sequence reads. After filtering for homopolymer errors, enzymatic fragmentation performed best if compared to the results of classic Sanger sequencing. As the overall performance of all three methods was equal with only minor differences, a fragmentation method can be chosen solely according to lab facilities, feasibility and experimental design.},

Across species, growth rate was positively related to vessel diameter and potential specific hydraulic conductance (K(p)), and negatively related to wood density. Survival rate was only positively related to wood density. *Light-demanding species were characterized by low wood and vessel density and wide vessels. Tall species were characterized by wide vessels with low density and large K(p). Hydraulic traits were more closely associated with adult stature than with light demand, possibly because tall canopy species experience more drought stress and face a higher cavitation risk. *Vessel traits affect growth and wood density affects growth and survival of large trees in the field. Vessel traits and wood density are therefore important components of the performance and life history strategies of tropical tree species.},

Although the deforestation rate is tending to decline, forests are confronted with climate change, which could profoundly modify their functioning. The migration of species that took place during the Pleistocene is no longer possible because human activities have markedly altered tropical landscapes. Forest species will thus have to adapt (or not) particularly to the increased water stress. Forest management methods must incorporate new knowledge on the vulnerability of species and evolve in order to reduce potentially negative interactions between disturbances and the water deficit. A key challenge is to identify trade-offs between logging in water deficit situations and the increased forest fire risk. In drylands, factors related to climate change are meshed with other change factors, but inno- vations in the management of woodlands could ensure their long-term persistence.},

abstract = {Hybridization has many and varied impacts on the process of speciation. Hybridization may slow or reverse differentiation by allowing gene flow and recombination. It may accelerate speciation via adaptive introgression or cause near-instantaneous speciation by allopolyploidization. It may have multiple effects at different stages and in different spatial contexts within a single speciation event. We offer a perspective on the context and evolutionary significance of hybridization during speciation, highlighting issues of current interest and debate. In secondary contact zones, it is uncertain if barriers to gene flow will be strengthened or broken down due to recombination and gene flow. Theory and empirical evidence suggest the latter is more likely, except within and around strongly selected genomic regions. Hybridization may contribute to speciation through the formation of new hybrid taxa, whereas introgression of a few loci may promote adaptive divergence and so facilitate speciation. Gene regulatory networks, epigenetic effects and the evolution of selfish genetic material in the genome suggest that the Dobzhansky-Muller model of hybrid incompatibilities requires a broader interpretation. Finally, although the incidence of reinforcement remains uncertain, this and other interactions in areas of sympatry may have knock-on effects on speciation both within and outside regions of hybridization. {\textcopyright} 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.},

abstract = {Light regimes beneath closed canopies and tree-fall gaps are compared for five temperate and tropical forests using fish-eye photography of intact forest canopies ad a model for calculating light penetration through idealized gaps. Beneath intact canopies, analysis of canopy photographs indicate that sunflects potentially contribute 37-68{\%} of seasonal total photosythetically active radiation. In all of the forests, potential sunfleck duration is brief (4-6 min), but the frequency distributions of potential sunfleck duration vary because of differeces in canopy geometry and recent disturbance history. Aalysis of the photographs reveals that incidence angles for photosynthetically active radiation beneath closed canopies are not generally vertical for any of the forests, but there was considerable variation both among and within sites in the contribution of overhead versus low-angle lighting. Calculations of light penetration through idealized single-tree gaps in old grouth Douglas-fir - hemlock forests indicate that such gaps have little effect on understory light regimes because of the high ration of canopy height to gap diameter. However, single-tree gaps in the other four forest types produce significant overall increases in understory light levels. There is also significant spatial variation in season total radiation in and around single-tree gaps. Our results demonstrate that there can be signifiicant penetration of light into the understory adjacent to the gap, particularly in high latitudes. As gap size increases, both the mean and the range of light levels within the gap increases, but even in large gaps (ca. 100 m2) the potential duration of direct sunlight is generally brief ({\textless} 4 h). The major differences in gap light regimes of the five forests are largely a gunction of canopy height and latitude. The effects of latitude should also result in differences in gap light regimes across the geographic range of individual forest types.},

abstract = {Natural disturbance is a fundamental component of the functioning of tropical rainforests let to natural dynamics, with tree mortality the driving force of forest renewal. With ongoing global (i.e. land-use and climate) changes, tropical forests are currently facing deep and rapid modifications in disturbance regimes that may hamper their recovering capacity so that developing robust predictive model able to predict ecosystem resilience and recovery becomes of primary importance for decision-making: (i) Do regenerating forests recover faster than mature forests given the same level of disturbance? (ii) Is the local topography an important predictor of the post-disturbance forest trajectories? (iii) Is the community functional composition, assessed with community weighted-mean functional traits, a good predictor of carbon stock recovery? (iv) How important is the climate stress (seasonal drought and/or soil water saturation) in shaping the recovery trajectory? Paracou is a large scale forest disturbance experiment set up in 1984 with nine 6.25 ha plots spanning on a large disturbance gradient where 15 to 60{\%} of the initial forest ecosystem biomass were removed. More than 70,000 trees belonging to ca. 700 tree species have then been censused every 2 years up today. Using this unique dataset, we aim at deciphering the endogenous (forest structure and composition) and exogenous (local environment and climate stress) drivers of ecosystem recovery in time. To do so, we disentangle carbon recovery into demographic processes (recruitment, growth, mortality fluxes) and cohorts (recruited trees, survivors). Variations in the pre-disturbance forest structure or in local environment do not shape significantly the ecosystem recovery rates. Variations in the pre-disturbance forest composition and in the post-disturbance climate significantly change the forest recovery trajectory. Pioneer-rich forests have slower recovery rates than assemblages of late-successional species. Soil water saturation during the wet season strongly impedes ecosystem recovery but not seasonal drought. From a sensitivity analysis, we highlight the pre-disturbance forest composition and the post-disturbance climate conditions as the primary factors controlling the recovery trajectory. Highly-disturbed forests and secondary forests because they are composed of a lot of pioneer species will be less able to cope with new disturbance. In the context of increasing tree mortality due to both (i) severe droughts imputable to climate change and (ii) human-induced perturbations, tropical forest management should focus on reducing disturbances by developing Reduced Impact Logging techniques.},

* •We compared six invasive forbs in Europe with six native forbs and six native graminoids in leaf and whole-plant traits, plasticity in response to nutrient supply and interspecific competition, litter decomposition rate, effects on soil nutrient availability, and allelopathy. All traits were measured in a series of pot experiments, and leaf traits additionally in the field.
* •Invasive forbs differed from native forbs for only a few traits; they had less leaf chlorophyll and lower phosphorus (P) uptake from soil, but they tended to have a stronger allelopathic effect. The invasive forbs differed in many traits from the native graminoids, their leaves had lower tissue densities and a shorter life span, their litter decomposed faster and they had a lower nitrogen-use efficiency.
* •Our results suggest that invasive forbs have the potential to alter ecosystem properties when invading graminoid-dominated and displacing native graminoids but not when displacing native forbs.},

abstract = {Tropical forests shelter the highest species diversity worldwide, a fact that remains partly unexplained and the origin of which is subject to debate. Even at the hectare-scale, tropical forests shelter species-rich genera with closely-related tree species coexisting in sympatry. Due to phylogenetic constraints, closely related species are expected to have similar niches and functional strategies, which raises questions on the mechanisms of their local coexistence. Closely related species may form a species complex, defined as morphologically similar species that share large amounts of genetic variation due to recent common ancestry and hybridization, and that can result from ecological adaptive radiation of species segregating along environmental gradients. Despite the key role of species complexes in Neotropical forest ecology, diversification, and evolution, little is known of the eco-evolutionary forces creating and maintaining diversity within Neotropical species complexes. We explored the intraspecific genomic variability as a continuum within structured populations of closely related species, and measured its role on individual tree performance through growth over time, while accounting for effects of a finely-characterized environment at the abiotic and biotic level. Combining tree inventories, LiDAR-derived topographic data, leaf functional traits, and gene capture data in the research station of Paracou, French Guiana, we used population genomics, environmental association analyses, genome-wide association studies and Bayesian modelling on the tree species complexes Symphonia and Eschweilera clade Parvifolia. We showed that the species complexes of Neotropical trees cover all local gradients of topography and competition and are therefore widespread in the study site whereas most of the species within them exhibit pervasive niche differentiation along these same gradients. Specifically, in the species complexes Symphonia and Eschweilera clade Parvifolia, the decrease in water availability due to higher topographic position, e.g., from bottomlands to plateaus, has led to a change in leaf functional traits from acquisitive strategies to conservative strategies, both among and within species. Symphonia species are genetically adapted to the distribution of water and nutrients, hence they coexist locally through exploiting a broad gradient of local habitats. Conversely, Eschweilera species are differentially adapted to soil chemistry and avoid the wettest, hydromorphic habitats. Last but not least, individual tree genotypes of Symphonia species are differentially adapted to regenerate and thrive in response to the fine spatio-temporal dynamics of forest gaps with divergent adaptive growth strategies along successional niches. Consequently, topography and the dynamics of forest gaps drive fine-scale spatio-temporal adaptations of individuals within and among distinct but genetically connected species within the species complexes Symphonia and Eschweilera clade Parvifolia. Fine-scale topography drives genetic divergence and niche differentiation with genetic adaptations among species, while forest gap dynamics maintains genetic diversity with divergent adaptive strategies within species. I suggest that adaptations of tree species and individuals to topography and dynamics of forest gaps promote coexistence within and among species within species complexes, and perhaps among mature forest tree species outside species complexes. Overall, I defend the primordial role of individuals within species in tropical forest diversity, suggesting that we should develop a theory of community ecology starting with individuals, because interactions with environments happen after all at the individual level.},

abstract = {This study explores the ecological significance of inter- and intraspecific variations of growth and functional traits found in tropical tree species of French Guiana in relation to light regime. We demonstrate that the syndrome of leaf traits associated with light -niche (longer life span, higher leaf mass per area of more shade tolerant species) holds among a set of 14 species comprising no pioneer nor any shade specialist species. Our results further suggest that plasticity of leaf mass per area expressed at the sapling stage may reflect adaptation to the spatial heterogeneity of light conditions encountered both at the sapling stage and across ontogenetic stages. Multivariate analysis provides evidence of a close linkage between leaf lifespan, relative crown depth and light-niche optimum. The plasticity in relative crown depth observed in shade-intolerant species can not be interpreted in terms of self-shading avoidance. Rather, crown depth adjustment was found to be a consequence of changes in growth rates and mortality rates of leaves and branches imposed by current light conditions and occurring at the whole-plant level. At the adult stage, our results point to competition for light making an unexpectedly low contribution to individual tree growth variations, contrasting with a major effect of species identity. We argue that this pattern of variation is likely to result from the vertical niche partitioning of species and the high abundance of small-statured species that are moderately responsive to light competition (consistent with their adaptation to understorey conditions). Light-niche differentiation of juvenile trees and vertical stratification of adult trees provide strong evidence for light niche partitioning in the three-dimensional space of tropical forests.},

Results: To gain a better understanding of the genome-wide distribution and functional impact of somatic mutations, we leverage the genomic information contained in the transcriptome to uniformly call somatic mutations from over 7500 tissue samples, representing 36 distinct tissues. This catalog, containing over 280,000 mutations, reveals a wide diversity of tissue-specific mutation profiles associated with gene expression levels and chromatin states. For example, lung samples with low expression of the mismatch-repair gene MLH1 show a mutation signature of deficient mismatch repair. In addition, we find pervasive negative selection acting on missense and nonsense mutations, except for mutations previously observed in cancer samples, which are under positive selection and are highly enriched in many healthy tissues. Conclusions: These findings reveal fundamental patterns of tissue-specific somatic evolution and shed light on aging and the earliest stages of tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {Under natural conditions ontogenetic development often coincides with changes in environmental factors. When explaining variations in leaf parameters, analyses based solely on environmental factors will lead to significant errors if the plant shows substantial ontogenetic variations in leaf properties. We evaluated intraspecific variations in eight morphological leaf traits of Dipterocarpus alatus over six architectural development stages under two different light conditions. An architectural analysis was conducted to distinguish precisely and objectively developmental stages of D. alatus. Leaves were collected on the most recent complete growth unit on the trunks of trees growing under two different light conditions. Eight leaf morphological traits were measured and calculated using ImageJ on greyscale images of leaf tracings. One-way ANOVA and Tukey tests were used to determine differences in leaf traits during ontogeny. The correlation coefficients were compared to determine whether leaf traits correlated more strongly with ontogenetic stage than with light intensity. D. alatus develops through a progressive transformation of its structure and architecture that adds one new axis category stage after stage. Specific leaf area, blade shape index and leaf dissection index decreased whereas blade area, perimeter, length, width and blade dry weight increased. Leaf traits correlated more strongly with ontogenetic stage than with light intensity. Our results demonstrated that studies on the responses of leaf traits to the environment may need to be corrected for an ontogeny effect. To strengthen this conclusion, future work should evaluate leaf variations during the ontogeny of different axis orders and/or axis categories. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

First, ADMIXTURE can be used to estimate the number of underlying populations through cross-validation. Second, individuals of known ancestry can be exploited in supervised learning to yield more precise ancestry estimates. Third, by penalizing small admixture coefficients for each individual, one can encourage model parsimony, often yielding more interpretable results for small datasets or datasets with large numbers of ancestral populations. Finally, by exploiting multiple processors, large datasets can be analyzed even more rapidly.Conclusions: The enhancements we have described make ADMIXTURE a more accurate, efficient, and versatile tool for ancestry estimation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Alexander and Lange; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {In seasonal plant communities, it is recognized that topography-related variation in water availability and solar radiation determine vegetation structure and community composition; however, the effects on functional structure, particularly through changes in resource use strategies of plants are still poorly understood. This study examines the effects of slope aspect and topographic position on functional trait dominance in a tropical dry forest landscape and explores whether strategies for coping with drought (avoidance vs. tolerance) segregate spatially along the water stress gradient created by the interaction of these two topographic factors. The study was conducted in the Balsas river basin in south-central Mexico. Functional traits were evaluated in 63 species of trees (≥ 2.5 cm diameter at breast height) dominant in plots located at three topographic positions (low, medium and high) and on two slope aspects (north and south). Eight leaf and four stem functional traits, relating to the plants' ability to avoid or tolerate water and temperature stress, were measured. Community-level functional traits were strongly affected by topographic position while only a weak signal was detected by the slope aspect. Contrary to our expectations, attributes associated with drought tolerance predominated on the lower topographic positions of the slopes, (moister and warmer sites), while on the upper parts with drier soil, but cooler air, attributes associated with water stress avoidance dominated. In addition, variation in the dominance of leaf pulvini and trichomes along the topographic gradient suggests environmental filtering by elevated air temperatures and water stress, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that the upper topographic positions that generate a shorter and more fluctuating water-availability window, favor readily-deciduous plants with high levels of water storage in their tissues, traits allowing for a rapid avoid of water stress, whereas on the lower topographic positions, where the soil remains moist for longer periods of time, tardily-deciduous species thrive with dense, low-water content tissues, attributes that are associated with physiological tolerance to drought.},

Cryptic species could be numerous in some taxa. Novel techniques, such as DNA barcoding, new databases, and crowd-sourcing, could greatly accelerate the rate of species discovery.

abstract = {Abstract: Mechanisms proposed to explain the maintenance of species diversity within ecological communities of sessile organisms include niche differentiation mediated by competitive trade‐offs, frequency dependence resulting from species‐specific pests, recruitment limitation due to local dispersal, and a speciation‐extinction dynamic equilibrium mediated by stochasticity (drift). While each of these processes, and more, have been shown to act in particular communities, much remains to be learned about their relative importance in shaping community‐level patterns. We used a spatially‐explicit, individual‐based model to assess the effects of each of these processes on species richness, relative abundance, and spatial patterns such as the species‐area curve. Our model communities had an order‐of‐magnitude more individuals than any previous such study, and we also developed a finite‐size scaling analysis to infer the large‐scale properties of these systems in order to establish the generality of our conclusions across system sizes. As expected, each mechanism can promote diversity. We found some qualitative differences in community patterns across communities in which different combinations of these mechanisms operate. Species‐area curves follow a power law with short‐range dispersal and a logarithmic law with global dispersal. Relative‐abundance distributions are more even for systems with competitive differences and trade‐offs than for those in which all species are competitively equivalent, and they are most even when frequency dependence (even if weak) is present. Overall, however, communities in which different processes operated showed surprisingly similar patterns, which suggests that the form of community‐level patterns cannot in general be used to distinguish among mechanisms maintaining diversity there. Nevertheless, parameterization of models such as these from field data on the strengths of the different mechanisms could yield insight into their relative roles in diversity maintenance in any given community.},

abstract = {To understand ecological phenomena, it is necessary to observe their behaviour across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Since this need was first highlighted in the 1980s, technology has opened previously inaccessible scales to observation. To help to determine whether there have been corresponding changes in the scales observed by modern ecologists, we analysed the resolution, extent, interval and duration of observations (excluding experiments) in 348 studies that have been published between 2004 and 2014. We found that observational scales were generally narrow, because ecologists still primarily use conventional field techniques. In the spatial domain, most observations had resolutions ≤1 m2 and extents ≤10,000 ha. In the temporal domain, most observations were either unreplicated or infrequently repeated ({\textgreater}1 month interval) and ≤1 year in duration. Compared with studies conducted before 2004, observational durations and resolutions appear largely unchanged, but intervals have become finer and extents larger. We also found a large gulf between the scales at which phenomena are actually observed and the scales those observations ostensibly represent, raising concerns about observational comprehensiveness. Furthermore, most studies did not clearly report scale, suggesting that it remains a minor concern. Ecologists can better understand the scales represented by observations by incorporating autocorrelation measures, while journals can promote attentiveness to scale by implementing scale-reporting standards.},

abstract = {* Despite the fundamental significance of water to plants and the persisting question of how competing species coexist, this is the first review of hydrological niches. We define hydrological niche segregation (HNS) as: (i) partitioning of space on fine-scale soil-moisture gradients, (ii) partitioning of water as a resource and/or (iii) partitioning of recruitment opportunities among years caused by species specializing on particular patterns of temporal variance of water supply (the storage effect). * We propose that there are three types of constraint that lead to the trade-offs that underlie HNS. (i) An edaphic constraint creates a trade-off between the supply to roots of O2 on the one hand vs. water and nutrients on the other. (ii) A biophysical constraint governs gas exchange by leaves, leading to a trade-off between CO2 acquisition vs. water loss. (iii) A structural constraint arising from the physics of water-conducting tissues leads to a safety vs. efficiency trade-off. * Significant HNS was found in 43 of 48 field studies across vegetation types ranging from arid to wet, though its role in coexistence remains to be proven in most cases. Temporal partitioning promotes coexistence through the storage effect in arid plant communities, but has yet to be shown elsewhere. In only a few cases is it possible to unequivocally link HNS to a particular trade-off. * Synthesis. The field and experimental evidence make it clear that HNS is widespread, though it is less clear what its precise mechanisms or consequences are. HNS mechanisms should be revealed by further study of the constraints and trade-offs that govern how plants obtain and use water, and HNS can be mechanistically linked to its consequences with appropriate community models. In a changing climate, such an integrated programme would pay dividends for global change research.},

abstract = {Individual-based forest models simulate forest dynamics on the basis of establishment, growth and death of individual trees. This paper attempts to review and compare two major types of individual-based forest models: growth-yield and gap models. Although the two types of models share some similar features, they differ in model structure and data requirements and play several complementary roles. Growth-yield models are used by foresters to assist timber production and evaluate growth and yield of one to several commercial timber species in managed forests, while gap models are generally developed by ecologists to explore ecological mechanisms and patterns of structure and functional dynamics in natural forest ecosystems. Site-specific environmental and species information is necessary for constructing growth-yield models while gap models require species-specific biological infomation of individual trees and site-specific environmental data. The growth-yield models are more diverse in terms of model structure. In contrast, gap models belong to the same genealogy and later gap models are ultimately derived from the earliest one although they may vary in detail. In the future, we expect to see more individual-ased hybrid models which integrate gap models with growth-yield models and ecophysiological models. As computer technology advances explosively, individual-based models could be much more efficient and user-friendly. There have existed disproportionately few individual-based models for biodiverse forests such as evergreen tropical rain forests. Development of individual-based models for tropical rain forests is more challenging and is being stimulated by new international conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Various patterns of multi-phenotype associations (MPAs) exist in the results of Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) involving different topologies of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-phenotype associations. These can provide interesting information about the different impacts of a gene on closely related phenotypes or disparate phenotypes (pleiotropy). In this work we present MPA Decomposition, a new network-based approach which decomposes the results of a multi-phenotype GWAS study into three bipartite networks, which, when used together, unravel the multi-phenotype signatures of genes on a genome-wide scale. The decomposition involves the construction of a phenotype powerset space, and subsequent mapping of genes into this new space. Clustering of genes in this powerset space groups genes based on their detailed MPA signatures. We show that this method allows us to find multiple different MPA and pleiotropic signatures within individual genes and to classify and cluster genes based on these SNP-phenotype association topologies. We demonstrate the use of this approach on a GWAS analysis of a large population of 882 Populus trichocarpa genotypes using untargeted metabolomics phenotypes. This method should prove invaluable in the interpretation of large GWAS datasets and aid in future synthetic biology efforts designed to optimize phenotypes of interest.},

abstract = {Organisms live in an ever-changing world. Most of evolutionary theory considers one solution to this problem: population-level adaptation. In fact, empirical studies have revealed an enormous variety of mechanisms to cope with environmental fluctuations. Some organisms use behavioral or physiological modifications that leave no permanent trace in the genes of future generations. Others withstand environmental change through the regular production of diverse offspring, in which the diversity can be either genetic or nongenetic. Evolutionary theorists now have the opportunity to catch up with the empirical evolutionary biology, and to integrate the diverse forms of 'adaptive variation' into a single conceptual framework. Here, we propose a classification according to the level at which the adaptive variation occurs and discuss some of the mechanisms underlying the variation. This perspective unites independent lines of research in molecular biology, microbiology, macroevolution, ecology, immunology and neurobiology, and suggests directions for a more comprehensive theory of adaptive variation.},

Interspecific variation in RSOM was equally large for BCI and Pasoh and was unrelated to gap dependence or life form for BCI species. The shape of the relationship between size and the proportion of individuals that were reproductive differed between forests, with an abrupt increase over a narrow range of sizes at Pasoh and a more gradual increase over a wider range of sizes at BCI. Both overtopping trees and heavy liana infestation reduced the probability that BCI trees were reproductive.

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Trait-based approaches applied to community ecology have led to a considerable advance in understanding the effect of environmental filters on species assembly. Although plant traits are known to vary both between and within species, little is known about the role of intraspecific trait variability in the non-random assembly mechanisms controlling the coexistence of species, including habitat filtering and niche differentiation. 2. We investigate the role of intraspecific variability in three key functional traits - specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and height - in structuring grassland communities distributed along a flooding gradient. We quantified the contribution of intraspecific variability relative to interspecific differences in the trait-gradient relationship, and we used a null model approach to detect patterns of habitat filtering and niche differentiation, with and without intraspecific variability. 3. Community mean SLA and height varied significantly along the flooding gradient and intraspecific variability accounted for 44{\%} and 32{\%}, respectively, of these trait-gradient relationships. LDMC did not vary along the gradient, with and without accounting for intraspecific variability. Our null model approach revealed significant patterns of habitat filtering and niche differentiation for SLA and height, but not for LDMC. More strikingly, considering intraspecific trait variability greatly increased the detection of habitat filtering and was necessary to detect niche differentiation processes. 4. Synthesis. Our study provides evidence for a strong role of intraspecific trait variability in community assembly. Our findings suggest that intraspecific trait variability promotes species coexistence, by enabling species to pass through both abiotic and biotic filters. We argue that community ecology would benefit from more attention to intraspecific variability.},

Here we explore the consequences of intraspecific trait variation for coexistence in two- and multispecies competitive communities. For two species, the likelihood of coexistence is in general reduced by intraspecific variation, except when the species have almost equal trait means but different trait variances, such that one is a generalist and the other a specialist consumer. In multispecies communities, the only strong effect of non-heritable intraspecific variation is to reduce expected species richness. However, when intraspecific variation is heritable, allowing for the possibility of trait evolution, communities are much more resilient against environmental disturbance and exhibit far more predictable trait patterns. Our results are robust to varying model parameters and relaxing model assumptions.},

abstract = {Comparisons of DNA from archaic and modern humans show that these groups interbred, and in some cases received an evolutionary advantage from doing so. This process - adaptive introgression - may lead to a faster rate of adaptation than is predicted from models with mutation and selection alone. Within the last couple of years, a series of studies have identified regions of the genome that are likely examples of adaptive introgression. In many cases, once a region was ascertained as being introgressed, commonly used statistics based on both haplotype as well as allele frequency information were employed to test for positive selection. Introgression by itself, however, changes both the haplotype structure and the distribution of allele frequencies, thus confounding traditional tests for detecting positive selection. Therefore, patterns generated by introgression alone may lead to false inferences of positive selection. Here we explore models involving both introgression and positive selection to investigate the behavior of various statistics under adaptive introgression. In particular, we find that the number and allelic frequencies of sites that are uniquely shared between archaic humans and specific present-day populations are particularly useful for detecting adaptive introgression. We then examine the 1000 Genomes dataset to characterize the landscape of uniquely shared archaic alleles in human populations. Finally, we identify regions that were likely subject to adaptive introgression and discuss some of the most promising candidate genes located in these regions.},

abstract = {At least 22 concepts of species are in use today and many of these are notably incompatible in their accounts of biological diversity. Much of the traditional turmoil embodied in the species problem ultimately derives from the packaging of inappropriate criteria for species into a single concept. This results from a traditional conflation of function of concepts with their applications, definitions with concepts, taxonomic categories with groups, and the ontological status of real species with teleological approaches to recover them. Analogous to classifications of supraspecific taxa, our forging inappropriate and ambiguous information relating to theoretical and operational discussions of species ultimately results in a trade-off between convenience, accuracy, precision, and the successful recovery of natural biological diversity. Hence, none of these expectations or intentions of species or classifications is attainable through composite, and possibly discordant, concepts of biological diversity or its descent. Reviowing and evaluating the concepts of species for their theoretical and operational qualities illustrates that a monistic, primary conept of species, applicable to the various entiies believed to be species, is essential. this evaluation reveals only one theoretical concept as appropriate for species, the Evolutionary Species Concept. This conceptualiztion functions as a primary concept and is essential in structuring our ideas and perceptions of real species in the natural world. The remaining concepts are secondary, forming a hierarchy of definitional guidelines subordinate to the primary concept, and are essential to the study of species in practice.

abstract = {The frequency of severe droughts is increasing in many regions around the world as a result of climate change. Droughts alter the structure and function of forests. Site- and region-specific studies suggest that large trees, which play keystone roles in forests and can be disproportionately important to ecosystem carbon storage and hydrology8, exhibit greater sensitivity to drought than small trees. Here, we synthesize data on tree growth and mortality collected during 40 drought events in forests worldwide to see whether this size-dependent sensitivity to drought holds more widely.We find that droughts consistently had a more detrimental impact on the growth and mortality rates of larger trees. Moreover, drought-related mor- tality increased with tree size in 65{\%} of the droughts examined, especially when community-wide mortality was high or when bark beetles were present. Themore pronounced drought sensitivity of larger trees could be underpinned by greater inherent vulnerability to hydraulic stress, the higher radiation and evaporative demand experienced by exposed crowns, and the tendency for bark beetles to preferentially attack larger trees16.We suggest that future droughts will have a more detri- mental impact on the growth andmortality of larger trees, potentially exacerbating feedbacks to climate change.},

abstract = {Dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) follow a process-based approach to simulate plant population demography, and have been used to address questions about disturbances, plant succession, community composition, and provisioning of ecosystem services under climate change scenarios. Despite their potential, they have seldom been used for studying species range dynamics explicitly. In this perspective paper, we make the case that DVMs should be used to this end and can improve our understanding of the factors that influence species range expansions and contractions. We review the benefits of using process-based, dynamic models, emphasizing how DVMs can be applied specifically to questions about species range dynamics. Subsequently, we provide a critical evaluation of some of the limitations and trade-offs associated with DVMs, and we use those to guide our discussions about future model development. This includes a discussion on which processes are lacking, specifically a mechanistic representation of dispersal, inclusion of the seedling stage, trait variability, and a dynamic representation of reproduction. We also discuss upscaling techniques that offer promising solutions for being able to run these models efficiently over large spatial extents. Our aim is to provide directions for future research efforts and to illustrate the value of the DVM approach.},

abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Wood density is the top predictor of growth and mortality rates (vital rates) but with modest explanatory power at best. Stronger links to vital rates are expected if wood density is decomposed into its anatomical properties at sapling and adult stages, since saplings and adults differ in wood traits and vital rates. We examined whether anatomical determinants of wood density and strength of the relationship between wood traits and vital rates shift between saplings and adults.METHODS: Using wood segments from near pith (sapling) and near bark (adult) for 20 tree species (three adults each) from Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we quantified wood traits. Vital rates for saplings and adults were obtained from an earlier study.KEY RESULTS: Anatomical predictors of wood density were similar for sapling and adult wood, with wood density variation largely explained by fiber lumen area and fiber wall fraction. In sapling wood only, growth rates decreased with fiber wall fraction and increased with fiber lumen area, while mortality rates increased with vessel area but decreased with fiber wall fraction and vessel density.CONCLUSIONS: Wood traits of sapling trees provide functional insight into the growth–mortality tradeoff. Sapling wood with relatively large fiber lumen area and wide vessels, enabling faster hydraulic transport but less mechanical strength, is associated with fast growth and high mortality. Sapling wood with relatively more fiber wall and many narrow vessels, enabling greater mechanical strength but slower hydraulic transport, is associated with slow growth and low mortality.},

abstract = {Summary: Biodiversity regulates ecosystem functions such as productivity, and experimental studies of species mixtures have revealed selection and complementarity effects driving these responses. However, the impacts of intraspecific genotypic diversity in these studies are unknown, despite it forming a substantial part of the biodiversity. In a glasshouse experiment we constructed plant communities with different levels of barley (Hordeum vulgare) genotype and weed species diversity and assessed their relative biodiversity effects through additive partitioning into selection and complementarity effects. Barley genotype diversity had weak positive effects on aboveground biomass through complementarity effects, whereas weed species diversity increased biomass predominantly through selection effects. When combined, increasing genotype diversity of barley tended to dilute the selection effect of weeds. We interpret these different effects of barley genotype and weed species diversity as the consequence of small vs large trait variation associated with intraspecific barley diversity and interspecific weed diversity, respectively. The different effects of intra- vs interspecific diversity highlight the underestimated and overlooked role of genetic diversity for ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {Grime's C-S-R triangle theory has been discussed in plant ecology for two decades, but it has rarely been tested, and not often dispassionately evaluated. We consider the theory from a community viewpoint, and attempt to develop and test predictions for plant communities. C-S-R assumes that in high-disturbance (ruderal, R) patches or habitats, competition will be absent, or low in intensity. Testing this is problematic because of the difficulty of defining the intensity of competition, and we could find no rigorous evidence to support or refute the prediction. The theory also implies that in high-disturbance habitats there will be no difference in species composition between 'competition' and 'stress' sites, but from available evidence this does not seem to be true. C-S-R assumes that in stressful (S) habitats, competition will be low. This assumption is difficult to define or test, because of the overall difference in plant growth rate between habitats. A prediction from the theory is that in stressful habitats autosuccession should occur, i.e. that the climax species should regenerate directly, with no specialist secondary pioneer (R) species. There is some evidence that autosuccession occurs under the most extreme stresses of various types. Previous criticisms of C-S-R are evaluated. Only a few are considered valid, mainly those that emphasise that C-S-R theory is a considerable simplification of reality. Previous tests of C-S-R theory appear to be inconclusive. C-S-R theory is basically a combination of r/K theory and Leaf Amortisation theory. We conclude that there is limited support for the C-S-R theory. Whether the gain in generality that the theory offers justifies the loss via simplification that it involves is still an open question. As formulated, it has limited utility as a predictive model in community ecology. Yet, it is currently the most comprehensive and coherent theory for community ecology.},

abstract = {The rainforest of Mexico has been degraded and severely fragmented, and urgently require restoration. However, the practice of restoration has been limited by the lack of species-specific data on survival and growth responses to local environmental variation. This study explores the differential performance of 14 wet tropical early-, mid- or late-successional tree species that were grown in two abandoned pastures with contrasting land-use histories. After 18 months, seedling survival and growth of at least 7 of the 14 tree species studied were significantly higher in the site with a much longer history of land use (site 2). Saplings of the three early-successional species showed exceptional growth rates. However, differences in performance were noted in relation to the differential soil properties between the experimental sites. Mid-successional species generally showed slow growth rates but high seedling survival, whereas late-successional species exhibited poor seedling survival at both the study sites. Stepwise linear regressions revealed that the species integrated response index combining survivorship and growth measurements, was influenced mostly by differences in soil pH between the two abandoned pastures. Our results suggest that local environmental variation among abandoned pastures of contrasting land-use histories influences sapling survival and growth. Furthermore, the similarity of responses among species with the same successional status allowed us to make some preliminary site and species-specific silvicultural recommendations. Future field experiments should extend the number of species and the range of environmental conditions to identify site generalists or more narrowly adapted species, that we would call sensitive.},

abstract = {Local adaptation is the first step in the process of ecological speciation. It is, however, an unstable and dynamic situation. It can be strengthened by the occurrence of alleles more specialized to the different habitats or vanish if generalist alleles arise by mutations and increase in frequency. This process can have complicated dynamics as specialist alleles may be much more common and may maintain local adaptation for a long time. Thus, even in the absence of an absolute fitness tradeoff between habitats, local adaptation may persist a long time before vanishing. Furthermore, several feedback loops can help to maintain it (the reinforcement, demographic, and recombination loops). This reinforcement can occur by modifying one of the three fundamental steps in a sexual life cycle (dispersal, syngamy, meiosis), which promotes genetic clustering by causing specific genetic associations. Distinguishing these mechanisms complements the one- versus two-allele classification. Overall, the relative rates of the two processes (specialization and reinforcement) dictate whether ecological speciation will occur. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2012 Thomas Lenormand.},

abstract = {Many empirical studies have assessed fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS), i.e. the nonrandom spatial distribution of genotypes, within plant populations using genetic markers and spatial autocorrelation techniques. These studies mostly provided qualitative descriptions of SGS, rendering quantitative comparisons among studies difficult. The theory of isolation by distance can predict the pattern of SGS under limited gene dispersal, suggesting new approaches, based on the relationship between pairwise relatedness coefficients and the spatial distance between individuals, to quantify SGS and infer gene dispersal parameters. Here we review the theory underlying such methods and discuss issues about their application to plant populations, such as the choice of the relatedness statistics, the sampling scheme to adopt, the procedure to test SGS, and the interpretation of spatial autocorrelograms. We propose to quantify SGS by an 'Sp' statistic primarily dependent upon the rate of decrease of pairwise kinship coefficients between individuals with the logarithm of the distance in two dimensions. Under certain conditions, this statistic estimates the reciprocal of the neighbourhood size. Reanalysing data from, mostly, published studies, the Sp statistic was assessed for 47 plant species. It was found to be significantly related to the mating system (higher in selfing species) and to the life form (higher in herbs than trees), as well as to the population density (higher under low density). We discuss the necessity for comparing SGS with direct estimates of gene dispersal distances, and show how the approach presented can be extended to assess (i) the level of biparental inbreeding, and (ii) the kurtosis of the gene dispersal distribution.},

abstract = {Recent work linking community structure and ecosystem function has primarily focused on the effects of local species richness but has neglected the dispersal-dependent processes of community assembly that are ultimately involved in determining community structure and its relation to ecosystems. Here we combine simple consumer-resource competition models and metacommunity theory with discussion of case studies to outline how spatial processes within metacommunities can alter community assembly and modify expectations about how species diversity and composition influence ecosystem attributes at local scales. We argue that when community assembly is strongly limited by dispersal, this can constrain ecosystem functioning by reducing positive selection effects (reducing the probability of the most productive species becoming dominant) even though it may often also enhance complementarity (favoring combinations of species that enhance production even though they may not individually be most productive). Conversely, excess dispersal with strong source-sink relations among heterogeneous habitats can reduce ecosystem functioning by swamping local filters that would normally favor better-suited species. Ecosystem function is thus most likely maximized at intermediate levels of dispersal where both of these effects are minimized. In this scenario, we find that the selection effect is maximized, while complementarity is often reduced and local diversity may often be relatively low. Our synthesis emphasizes that it is the entire set of community assembly processes that affect the functioning of ecosystems, not just the part that determines local species richness.},

Common observations regarding the structure of syngameons are that hybridization propensity is not uniform across species and that patterns of hybridization are dominated by a few species. I use computer simulations to test these claims in naturally occurring syngameons selected from the literature and from personal observation. Natural syngameons, especially those involving plants, typically exhibit nonrandom structure: The first three order statistics for the number of hybrid partners and the variance in the number of hybrid partners are larger than chance alone would predict. The structure of two insect syngameons examined is not significantly different from random. To test a hypothesis that variation in hybridization propensity across species in natural syngameons is simply an artifact of hybridization opportunity, I examine the structure of four artificial syngameons (fertility relationships) produced by full diallel crosses. Three of four artificial syngameons exhibit nonrandom structure, as the observed variation in number of successful crosses is larger than chance alone would predict. In general, there are no significant results involving the order statistics. Finally, I discuss biogeographic, ecological, and phylogenetic hypotheses for variation in hybridization propensity across species in natural syngameons.},

abstract = {Tropical forests of the Guiana Shield are the most affected by gold-mining in South America, experiencing an exponential increase in deforestation since the early 2000's. Using yearly deforestation data encompassing Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana and the Brazilian State of Amap{\'{a}}, we demonstrated a strong relationship between deforestation due to gold-mining and gold-prices at the regional scale. In order to assess additional drivers of deforestation due to gold-mining, we focused on the national scale and highlighted the heterogeneity of the response to gold-prices under different political contexts. Deforestation due to gold-mining over the Guiana Shield occurs mainly in Guyana and Suriname. On the contrary, past and current repressive policies in Amap{\'{a}} and French Guiana likely contribute to the decorrelation of deforestation and gold prices. In this work, we finally present a case study focusing on French Guiana and Suriname, two neighbouring countries with very different levels of law enforcement against illegal gold-mining. We developed a modelling framework to estimate potential deforestation leakages from French Guiana to Suriname in the border areas. Based on our assumptions, we estimated a decrease in deforestation due to gold-mining of approx. 4300 hectares in French Guiana and an increase of approx. 12 100 hectares in Suriname in response to the active military repression of illegal gold-mining launched in French Guiana. Gold-mining in the Guiana Shield provides challenging questions regarding REDD+ implementation. These questions are discussed at the end of this study and are important to policy makers who need to provide sustainable alternative employment to local populations in order to ensure the effectiveness of environmental policies.},

However, few attempts have been made to confirm these in natural systems, especially in forests. Furthermore, one of the most interesting unresolved questions is whether the effects of complementarity on ecosystem functioning (EF) decrease in favour of competitive exclusions over an increasing productivity gradient. Using records from permanent forest plots, we asked the following questions. (1) Is tree productivity positively related to diversity? (2) Does the effect of diversity increase in less productive forests? (3) What metric of diversity (e.g. functional or phylogenetic diversity) better relates to tree productivity?Location Temperate, mixed and boreal forests of eastern Canada.Methods Over 12,000 permanent forest plots, from temperate to boreal forests, were used to test our hypotheses in two steps. (1) Stepwise regressions were used to identify the best explanatory variables for tree productivity. (2) The selected climatic and environmental variables, as well as density and biodiversity indices, were included in a structural equation model where links (paths) between covarying variables are made explicit, making structural equation modelling the best tool to explore such complicated causal networks.Results This is the first large-scale demonstration of a strong, positive and significant effect of biodiversity on tree productivity with control for climatic and environmental conditions. Important differences were noted between the two forest biomes investigated.Main conclusions We show for the first time that complementarity may be less important in temperate forests growing in a more stable and productive environment where competitive exclusion is the most probable outcome of species interactions, whereas in the more stressful environment of boreal forests, beneficial interactions between species may be more important. The present work is also a framework for the analysis of large datasets in biodiversity–ecosystem functioning (B-EF) research.},

It uses quantitative genetics theory to produce an explicit description of the typical life cycle of monoecious and hermaphroditic plant species. Genome structure, the relationship between genotype and phenotype, and the effects of landscape heterogeneity on each individual can be finely parameterized by the user. Unlike most existing simulation packages, Metapop can simulate phenotypic plasticity, which may have a genetic component, and assortative mating, two important features of tree species. Each simulation is parameterized through text files, and raw data are generated recurrently, describing the allelic state of each quantitative trait locus involved in phenotypic variability. The data can be generated in Genepop or Fstat format, and may thus be analysed with other existing packages. Metapop also automatically computes a range of populations statistics, enabling the user to monitor evolutionary dynamics directly, from gene to metapopulation level.},

abstract = {Functional diversity is a key facet of biodiversity that is increasingly being measured to quantify its changes following disturbance and to understand its effects on ecosystem functioning. Assessing the functional diversity of assemblages based on species traits requires the building of a functional space (dendrogram or multidimensional space) where indices will be computed.However, there is still no consensus on the best method for measuring the quality of functional spaces. Innovation Here we propose a framework for evaluating the quality of a func- tional space (i.e. the extent to which it is a faithful representation of the initial functional trait values). Using simulated datasets, we analysed the influence of the number and type of functional traits used and of the number of species studied on the identity and quality of the best functional space. We also tested whether the quality of the functional space affects functional diversity patterns in local assem- blages, using simulated datasets and a real study case. Main conclusions The quality of functional space strongly varied between situa- tions. Spaces having at least four dimensions had the highest quality, while func- tional dendrograms and two-dimensional functional spaces always had a low quality. Importantly, we showed that using a poor-quality functional space could led to a biased assessment of functional diversity and false ecological conclusions. Therefore,we advise a pragmatic approach consisting of computing all the possible functional spaces and selecting the most parsimonious one.},

abstract = {Studies of host specificity in tropical insect herbivores are evolving from a focus on insect distribution data obtained by canopy fogging and other mass collecting methods, to a focus on obtaining data on insect rearing and experimentally verified feeding patterns. We review this transition and identify persisting methodological problems. Replicated quantitative surveys of plant-herbivore food webs, based on sampling efforts of an order of magnitude greater than is customary at present, may be cost-effectively achieved by small research teams supported by local assistants. Survey designs that separate historical and ecological determinants of host specificity by studying herbivores feeding on the same plant species exposed to different environmental or experimental conditions are rare. Further, we advocate the use of host-specificity measures based on plant phylogeny. Existing data suggest that a minority of species in herbivore communities feed on a single plant species when alternative congeneric hosts are available. Thus, host plant range limits tend to coincide with those of plant genera, rather than species or suprageneric taxa. Host specificity among tropical herbivore guilds decreases in the sequence: granivores 〉 leaf-miners 〉 fructivores 〉 leaf-chewers = sap-suckers 〉 xylophages 〉 root-feeders, thus paralleling patterns observed in temperate forests. Differences in host specificity between temperate and tropical forests are difficult to assess since data on tropical herbivores originate from recent field studies, whereas their temperate counterparts derive from regional host species lists, assembled over many years. No major increase in host specificity from temperate to tropical communities is evident. This conclusion, together with the recent downward revisions of extremely high estimates of tropical species richness, suggest that tropical ecosystems may not be as biodiverse as previously thought. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Royal Society.},

Microclimatic conditions inside the stands were monitored: air temperature, soil temperature, air relative humidity and global radiation. A reference station was installed in an open area nearby. Forest cover has a weak effect on temperatures: air and soil temperatures are warmer in the mixed broadleaved-pine stand and the coldest under the pine plantation. No difference in relative humidity (h, {\%}) or vapour pressure deficit (D, Pa) was observed across the forest maturing stages, but a strong effect of forest cover in general was observed. Radiation was highly attenuated beneath the canopy and was the most heterogeneous variable between and within stands. These variations were significantly and negatively related to the local basal area or canopy cover; the exact shape of the relationship could not be assessed because of too few spatial data. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {1. The development of simple predictors of tree growth is important in understanding forest dynamics. For this purpose, tree height, crown width in two perpendicular directions, trunk diameter at 1.3 m height (d.b.h.) and crown illumination index (CI) were determined for 727 pole-sized trees (8-20 cm d.b.h.) of 21 species, on forest dynamics plots at Pasoh Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia and Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia. A light-interception index (LI = A(cr)CI(2), where A(cr) is crown area) was calculated for each tree, and wood density (stem wood dry mass/fresh volume) was estimated for each species from reported values.2. Diameter growth rates were linearly correlated with LI (mean per species r(2) = 0.45, excluding substantially damaged and vine-covered trees).3. Among trees of all species, diameter growth rate was highly correlated with LI/wood density.4. Mean growth rate per species varied 10-fold among the study species, but increased linearly with mean LI/wood density ratio (r(2) = 0.78), consistent with the previous pattern.5. Thus much of the variability in tree growth rates, both within and among species, can be accounted for by the simple mechanistic assumption that, within a given size class, growth is proportional to light interception/wood density.},

We investigated the soil seed bank, and followed seedlings from emergence and establishment to the sapling stage in artificially created gaps in secondary forest on the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panam{\'{a}}. 2. To simulate microsite variation within gaps, litter addition/removal and soil disturbance treatments were applied to seedling plots in a factorial design. 3. Seedling emergence was almost three-fold higher in litter-free plots than in control plots. 4. We found a negative relationship between seed mass and seed abundance in the soil, seed mass was positively correlated with seedling emergence success from the seed bank and with seedling survival through to the end of the first dry season. 5. In the 18 months following the first dry season we observed an uncoupling of seed mass from seedling performance. Seedling mortality was now a function of maximum relative growth rate, with higher mortality of fast-growing species attributable to herbivory, notably by shoot-borers. 6. We propose that a seed size-dependent trade-off between dispersal success (selecting for large seed number), and emergence-establishment success (selecting for large seed size) can explain the maintenance of wide variation in seed size among pioneer species. Secondarily, a trade-off between growth rate and susceptibility to herbivores acting at the post-establishment phase may contribute to observed differences in light requirements among pioneer species.},

abstract = {Soil moisture is a key factor affecting plant abundance and distribution, both across and within species. In response to water limitation, plants have evolved numerous morphological, physiological, and phenological adaptations. In both well-watered and water-limited conditions, we identified considerable natural variation in drought-related whole-plant and leaf-level traits among closely related members of the Mimulus guttatus species complex that occupy a diversity of habitats in the field. The self-fertilizing Mimulus nasutus and serpentine-endemic Mimulus nudatus demonstrated the overall greatest tolerance to soil water limitation, exhibiting the smallest reduction in seed set relative to well-watered conditions. This may be due in part to early flowering, faster fruit development, and low stomatal density. In contrast, flowering of coastal M. guttatus was so delayed that it precluded any seed production in water-limited conditions. This range of phenotypic responses to soil water deficit in Mimulus, coupled with developing genomic resources, holds considerable promise for identifying genomic variation responsible for adaptive responses to soil water availability. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract = {Understanding patterns of functional trait variation across environmental gradients offers an opportunity to increase inference in the mechanistic causes of plant community assembly. The leaf economics spectrum (LES) predicts global tradeoffs in leaf traits and trait-environment relationships, but few studies have examined whether these predictions hold across different levels of organization, particularly within species. Here, we asked (1) whether the main assumptions of the LES (expected trait relationships and shifts in trait values across resource gradients) hold at the intraspecific level, and (2) how within-species trait correlations scale up to interspecific or among-community levels. We worked with leaf traits of saplings of woody species growing across light and soil N and P availability gradients in temperate rainforests of southern Chile. We found that ITV accounted for a large proportion of community-level variation in leaf traits (e.g., LMA and leaf P) and played an important role in driving community-level shifts in leaf traits across environmental gradients. Additionally, intraspecific leaf trait relationships were generally consistent with interspecific and community-level trait relationships and with LES predictions-e.g., a strong negative intraspecific LMA-leaf N correlation-although, most trait relationships varied significantly among species, suggesting idiosyncrasies in the LES at the intraspecific level.},

abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of phenotypes among populations is of major importance for species evolution and ecosystem functioning. Dispersal has long been assumed to homogenise populations in structured landscapes by generating maladapted gene flows, making spatial heterogeneity of phenotypes traditionally considered resulting from local adaptation or plasticity. However, there is accumulating evidence that individuals, instead of dispersing randomly in the landscapes, adjust their dispersal decisions according to their phenotype and the environmental conditions. Specifically, individuals might move in the landscape to find and settle in the environmental conditions that best match their phenotype, therefore maximizing their fitness, a hypothesis named habitat matching. Although habitat matching and associated non-random gene flows can produce spatial phenotypic heterogeneity, their potential consequences for metapopulation and metacommunity functioning are still poorly understood. Here, we discuss evidence for intra and interspecific drivers of habitat matching, and highlight the potential consequences of this process for metapopulation and metacommunity functioning. We conclude that habitat matching might deeply affect the eco-evolutionary dynamics of meta-systems, pointing out the need for further empirical and theoretical research on its incidence and implications for species and communities evolution under environmental changes.},

abstract = {1. Plant functional traits, in particular specific leaf area (SLA), wood density and seed mass, are often good predictors of individual tree growth rates within communities. Individuals and species with high SLA, low wood density and small seeds tend to have faster growth rates. 2. If community-level relationships between traits and growth have general predictive value, then similar relationships should also be observed in analyses that integrate across taxa, biogeographic regions and environments. Such global consistency would imply that traits could serve as valuable proxies for the complex suite of factors that determine growth rate, and, therefore, could underpin a new generation of robust dynamic vegetation models. Alternatively, growth rates may depend more strongly on the local environment or growth–trait relationships may vary along environmental gradients. 3. We tested these alternative hypotheses using data on 27 352 juvenile trees, representing 278 species from 27 sites on all forested continents, and extensive functional trait data, 38{\%} of which were obtained at the same sites at which growth was assessed. Data on potential evapotranspiration (PET), which summarizes the joint ecological effects of temperature and precipitation, were obtained from a global data base. 4. We estimated size-standardized relative height growth rates (SGR) for all species, then related them to functional traits and PET using mixed-effect models for the fastest growing species and for all species together. 5. Both the mean and 95th percentile SGR were more strongly associated with functional traits than with PET. PET was unrelated to SGR at the global scale. SGR increased with increasing SLA and decreased with increasing wood density and seed mass, but these traits explained only 3.1{\%} of the variation in SGR. SGR–trait relationships were consistently weak across families and biogeographic zones, and over a range of tree statures. Thus, the most widely studied functional traits in plant ecology were poor predictors of tree growth over large scales. 6. Synthesis. We conclude that these functional traits alone may be unsuitable for predicting growth of trees over broad scales. Determining the functional traits that predict vital rates under specific environmental conditions may generate more insight than a monolithic global relationship can offer.},

We compare by a simulation study results from fitting this lognormal model with either applying the log transformation or not transforming the data. We found that the lognormal model provided more precise estimates and more powerful tests than a simple log transformation when analyzing lognormally distributed data. Power varied with sibship size. For the same total number of nonindependent sibpairs, larger sibships were less powerful. However, larger sibships are more economical because they require a smaller sample size to obtain a specified power. To illustrate the application of this lognormal model to real data, we studied evidence for linkage between triglycerides and the lipoprotein lipase gene.},

abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950–2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

abstract = {Individuals often differ in what they do. This has been recognised since antiquity. Nevertheless, the ecological and evolutionary significance of such variation is attracting widespread interest, which is burgeoning to an extent that is fragmenting the literature. As a first attempt at synthesis, we focus on individual differences in behaviour within populations that exceed the day-to-day variation in individual behaviour (i.e. behavioural specialisation). Indeed, the factors promoting ecologically relevant behavioural specialisation within natural populations are likely to have far- reaching ecological and evolutionary consequences. We discuss such individual differences from three distinct perspectives: individual niche specialisations, the division of labour within insect societies and animal personality variation. In the process, while recognising that each area has its own unique motivations, we identify a number of opportunities for productive ‘crossfertilisation' among the (largely independent) bodies of work. We conclude that a complete understanding of evolutionarily and ecologically relevant individual differences must specify how ecological interactions impact the basic biological process (e.g. Darwinian selection, development and information processing) that underpin the organismal features determining behavioural specialisations. Moreover, there is likely to be covariation amongst behavioural specialisations. Thus, we sketch the key elements of a general framework for studying the evolutionary ecology of individual differences.},

abstract = {The Janzen-Connell hypothesis explains the maintenance of tropical diversity through the interacting effects of parent-centered dispersal patterns and distance- and density-dependent propagule survival. These effects were thought to support regular spacing of species within tropical forest, enhancing diversity. One of the predictions of the hypothesis is that seed and seedling survival should improve with increased parental distance. Although there are many independent tests of this hypothesis for individual species, there are few synthetic studies that have brought these data together to test its validity across species. This paper reports the results of a meta-analysis of the effect of distance on enhancing propagule survival, employing an odds-ratio effect size metric. We found no general support for the distance-dependent prediction of the hypothesis, and conclude that further testing to explore this hypothesis as a diversity-maintaining mechanism is unnecessary. However, we did find that distance from parent slightly reduces survivorship in the temperate zone, as contrasted with the tropics, and we saw stronger evidence in support of the hypothesis for seedlings than for seeds. The phenomenon of enhanced propagule survival with distance from the parent may be important for the population biology of particular species, but it is not a general phenomenon across communities, life history stages or life forms.},

Despite growing evidence for intraspecific trait differences, it remains unclear under which circumstances the effects of environmental gradients trump those of ontogeny and taxonomy on important functional dimensions related to resource use, particularly in tropical forests. Here, we explore how physiological, chemical, and morphological traits related to resource use vary between life stages in four species within the genus Micropholis that is widespread in lowland Amazonia. Specifically, we evaluate how environment, developmental stage, and taxonomy contribute to single-trait variation and multidimensional functional strategies. We find that environment, developmental stage, and taxonomy differentially contribute to functional dimensions. Habitats and seasons shape physiological and chemical traits related to water and nutrient use, whereas developmental stage and taxonomic identity impact morphological traits –especially those related to the leaf economics spectrum. Our findings suggest that combining environment, ontogeny, and taxonomy allows for a better understanding of important functional dimensions in tropical trees and highlights the need for integrating tree physiological and chemical traits with classically used morphological traits to improve predictions of tropical forests' responses to environmental change.},

According to this model, the scaling of reproduction is governed by numerous taxon-specific scaling exponents and constants that reflect the allometry of vegetative biomass partitioning. Although this allometry cannot be predicted a priori, the model accurately predicts all observed inter- and intraspecific repro- ductive biomass trends based on the exponents and constants determined for a worldwide database representative of herbaceous and tree-sized dicot, monocot and conifer species grow- ing in diverse habitats. The model also identifies the body proportions for which reproduction is energetically untenable. The limits for seed plant reproductive biomass are thus established, providing a conceptual and quantitative basis for understanding the scaling of reproductive capacity across and within ecologically and evolutionarily diverse spermatophytes.},

abstract = {Much research has shown that environmental stress can induce adaptive and maladaptive phenotypic changes in organisms that persist for multiple generations. Such transgenerational phenotypic plasticity shrouds our understanding of the long-term consequences of ongoing anthropogenic pressures. 2. Here, we evaluated within- and transgenerational phenotypic responses to food stress in the freshwater crustacean, Daphnia. We reared 45 clones of Daphnia pulicaria each on high-quality Scenedesmus and low-quality (but also non-toxic) cyanobacteria (generation 1). Offspring produced by generation 1 adults were then reared on Scenedesmus (generation 2) and life history traits were measured across both generations. 3. The results show that Daphnia in generation 1 exhibited reduced fitness (i.e. delayed maturation, lower reproductive output, increased clutch interval) when reared in the presence of cyanobacteria as opposed to high-quality food. However, maternal stress had no clear influence on the fitness of offspring. That is, Daphnia in the second experimental generation had similar mean trait values, irrespective of whether their mothers were reared on cyanobacteria or high-quality food. 4. Signals of transgenerational life history effects were obscured, in part, by extensive clonal variation among Daphnia in the direction of transgenerational responses to cyanobacteria (i.e. adaptive and maladaptive plasticity). Further analyses demonstrated that such individual variance in plasticity might be open to selection and potentially offer a means of contemporary adaptation to cyanobacteria. Taken together, our results denote a link between the overall strength of transgenerational responses to the environment and the potential for rapid evolution in populations.},

abstract = {Metabolism provides a basis for using first principles of physics, chemistry, and biology to link the biology of individual organisms to the ecology of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

@article{Bugmann2001,
abstract = {Forest gap models, initially conceived in 1969 as a special case of individual-tree based models, have become widely popular among forest ecologists for addressing a large number of applied research questions, including the impacts of global change on long-term dynamics of forest structure, biomass, and composition. However, they have been strongly criticized for a number of weaknesses inherent in the original model structure. In this paper, I review the fundamental assumptions underlying forest gap models, the structure of the parent model JABOWA, and examine these criticisms in the context of the many alternative formulations that have been developed over the past 30 years. Four assumptions originally underlie gap models: (1) The forest is abstracted as a composite of many small patches of land, where each can have a different age and successional stage; (2) patches are horizontally homogeneous, i.e., tree position within a patch is not considered; (3) the leaves of each tree are located in an indefinitely thin layer (disk) at the top of the stem; and (4) successional processes are described on each patch separately, i.e., there are no interactions between patches. These simplifications made it possible to consider mixed-species, mixed-age forests, which had been difficult previously mainly because of computing limitations. The structure of JABOWA is analysed in terms of the functional relationships used for formulating the processes of tree establishment, growth, and mortality. It is concluded that JABOWA contains a number of unrealistic assumptions that have not been questioned strongly to date. At the same time, some aspects of JABOWA that were criticized strongly in the past years are internally consistent given the objectives of this specific model. A wide variety of formulations for growth processes, establishment, and mortality factors have been developed in gap models over the past 30 years, and modern gap models include more robust parameterizations of environmental influences on tree growth and population dynamics as compared to JABOWA. Approaches taken in more recent models that led to the relaxation of one or several of the four basic assumptions are discussed. It is found that the original assumptions often have been replaced by alternatives; however, no systematic analysis of the behavioral effects of these conceptual changes has been attempted to date. The feasibility of including more physiological detail (instead of using relatively simple parameterizations) in forest gap models is discussed, and it is concluded that we often lack the data base to implement such approaches for more than a few commercially important tree species. Hence, it is important to find a compromise between using simplistic parameterizations and expanding gap models with physiology-based functions and parameters that are difficult to estimate. While the modeling of tree growth has received a lot of attention over the past years, much less effort has been spent on improving the formulations of tree establishment and mortality, although these processes are likely to be just as sensitive to global change as tree growth itself. Finally, model validation issues are discussed, and it is found that there is no single data source that can reliably be used for evaluating the behavior of forest gap models; instead, I propose a combination of sensitivity analyses, qualitative examinations of process formulations, and quantitative tests of gap models or selected submodels against various kinds of empirical data to evaluate the usefulness of these models for assessing their utility for predicting the impacts of global change on long-term forest dynamics. },

abstract = {Life-history traits are often plastic in response to environmental factors such as temperature or precipitation, and they also vary with age in many species. Trait variation during the lifetime could thus be partly driven by age-dependent plasticity in these traits. We study whether plasticity of a phenological trait—the egg-laying date—with respect to spring temperature, varies with age, and explore whether this variation relates to changes in breeding success throughout the life cycle. We use data from a four-decade long-term monitoring of a wild population of blue tits in Corsica, to estimate age-dependent plasticity of reproductive phenology and annual reproductive success. We show that both laying date plasticity and annual reproductive success vary with age: young and old females are less plastic, and fledge fewer offspring, than middle-age females. Furthermore, in contrast to young and prime-age females, in old females fledging success does not depend on laying date. Phenological plasticity is a major mechanism for coping with rapid environmental variation. Our results suggest that understanding its role in adaptation to climate change and population persistence requires integrating the age structure of the population.},

Demographic frameworks like matrix models or integral projection models represent powerful approaches to disentangle mechanisms linking individual life histories and population-level processes. Recent developments have provided important steps towards their application to study eco-evolutionary dynamics, but so far individual heterogeneity has largely been ignored. Here, we present a general demographic framework that incorporates individual heterogeneity in a flexible way, by separating static and dynamic traits (discrete or continuous). First, we apply the framework to derive the consequences of ignoring heterogeneity for a range of widely used demographic outputs. A general conclusion is that besides the long-term growth rate lambda, all parameters can be affected. Second, we discuss how the framework can help advance current demographic models of eco-evolutionary dynamics, by incorporating individual heterogeneity. For both applications numerical examples are provided, including an empirical example for pike. For instance, we demonstrate that predicted demographic responses to climate warming can be reversed by increased heritability. We discuss how applications of this demographic framework incorporating individual heterogeneity can help answer key biological questions that require a detailed understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics.},

Spatial autocorrelation statistics are often used for this purpose, but their relationships with population genetics models have not been thoroughly established. Moreover, it has been argued that the dependency of these statistics on variation in mutation rates among loci strongly limits their interest for inferential purposes. In the context of an isolation by distance process, we describe relationships between a descriptor of the spatial genetic structure used in empirical studies, Moran's I statistic and population genetics parameters. In particular, we point out that, when Moran's I statistic is used to describe correlation in allele frequencies at the individual level, it provides an estimator of Wright's coefficient of relationship. We also show that the latter parameter, as a descriptor of genetic structure, is not influenced by selfing rate or ploidy level. Under specific finite population models, numerical simulations show that values of Moran's I statistic can be predicted from analytical theory. These simulations are also used to estimate the time taken to approach a structure at equilibrium. Finally, we discuss the conditions under which spatial autocorrelation statistics are little influenced by variation in mutation rates, so that they could be used to estimate gene dispersal parameters.},

abstract = {The future of tropical forests under global environmental change is uncertain, with biodiversity and carbon stocks at risk if precipitation regimes alter. Here, we assess changes in plant functional composition and biomass in 19 plots from a variety of forest types during two decades of long-term drought in Ghana. We find a consistent increase in dry forest, deciduous, canopy species with intermediate light demand and a concomitant decrease in wet forest, evergreen, sub-canopy and shade-tolerant species. These changes in composition are accompanied by an increase in above-ground biomass. Our results indicate that by altering composition in favour of drought-tolerant species, the biomass stocks of these forests may be more resilient to longer term drought than short-term studies of severe individual droughts suggest.},

abstract = {Background: Profile hidden Markov models (profile-HMMs) are sensitive tools for remote protein homology detection, but the main scoring algorithms, Viterbi or Forward, require considerable time to search large sequence databases.Results: We have designed a series of database filtering steps, HMMERHEAD, that are applied prior to the scoring algorithms, as implemented in the HMMER package, in an effort to reduce search time. Using this heuristic, we obtain a 20-fold decrease in Forward and a 6-fold decrease in Viterbi search time with a minimal loss in sensitivity relative to the unfiltered approaches. We then implemented an iterative profile-HMM search method, JackHMMER, which employs the HMMERHEAD heuristic. Due to our search heuristic, we eliminated the subdatabase creation that is common in current iterative profile-HMM approaches. On our benchmark, JackHMMER detects 14{\%} more remote protein homologs than SAM's iterative method T2K.Conclusions: Our search heuristic, HMMERHEAD, significantly reduces the time needed to score a profile-HMM against large sequence databases. This search heuristic allowed us to implement an iterative profile-HMM search method, JackHMMER, which detects significantly more remote protein homologs than SAM's T2K and NCBI's PSI-BLAST. {\textcopyright} 2010 Johnson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {We used genotypes from six microsatellite loci and demographic data from a large mapped forest plot to study changes in spatial genetic structure across demographic stages, from seed rain to seedlings, juveniles, and adult diameter classes in the Neotropical tree, Jacaranda copaia. In pairwise comparisons of genetic differentiation among demographic classes, only seedlings were significantly differentiated from the other diameter classes; FST values ranged from 0.006 to 0.009. Furthermore, only seedlings showed homozygote excess suggesting biparental inbreeding in the large diameter reproductive adults. We found very low levels of relatedness in the first distance class of trees, 1-26 cm diameter (Fij = 0.011). However, there was a 5- to 10-fold rise in relatedness in the smallest distance class, from the smallest to the largest tree diameter classes (Fij = 0.110 for individuals {\textgreater} 56 cm diameter). A variety of non-mutually exclusive mechanisms have been invoked perviously to explain such a pattern, including natural selection, history, or nonequilibrium population dynamics. The long-term demographic data available for this species allow us to evaluate these mechanisms. Jacaranda is a fast-growing, light-demanding species with low recruitment rates and high mortality rates in the smaller diameter classes. It successfully regenerates only in large light gaps, which occur infrequently and stochastically in space and time. These factors contribute to the nonequilibrium population dynamics and observed low genetic structure in the small size classes. We conclude that the pattern of spatial genetic transitions in Jacaranda is consistent with overlapping related generations and strong but infrequent periods of high recruitment, followed by long periods of population decline. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.},

abstract = {Urbanization is considered a global threat to biodiversity; the growth of cities results in an increase in impervious surfaces, soil and air pollution, fragmentation of natural vegetation and invasion of non-native species, along with numerous environmental changes, including the heat island phenomenon. The combination of these effects constitutes a challenge for both the survival and persistence of many native species, while also imposing altered selective regimes. Here, using 110 314 single nucleotide polymorphisms generated by restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing, we investigated the genomewide effects of urbanization on putative neutral and adaptive genomic diversity in a major insect pollinator, Bombus lapidarius, collected from nine German cities and nine paired rural sites. Overall, genetic differentiation among siteswas lowand therewas no obvious genome-wide genetic structuring, suggesting the absence of strong effects of urbanization on gene flow. We nevertheless identified several loci under directional selection, a subset of which was associated with urban land use, including the percentage of impervious surface surrounding each sampling site. Overall, our results provide evidence of local adaptation to urbanization in the face of gene flow in a highly mobile insect pollinator.},

Here, we show that a set of habits that are—surprisingly—shared among successful artists and scientists may catalyze creative output. We reveal three groups of such habits, each corresponding to a cluster of personality traits, shown to be shared by creative artists and scientists. The first habit group “embrace the unexpected” corresponds to the character trait “openness to new experiences” and encompasses tendencies to go ahead without a plan, collect diverse experiences, and take risks. The second group “create conditions for creation” links to the personality trait “autonomous” and encompasses simple habits such as making empty time and carrying a notebook. The third class of habits “break away from dogma” links to the shared personality trait “norm doubting” and stands for a strong drive to escape from established systems and also occasionally destroy part of one's own work to break tunnel vision and start anew. Although personality traits are hard to change, the habits we found hint at techniques or skills that may be taught.},

abstract = {Biodiversity loss from deforestation may be partly offset by the expansion of secondary forests and plantation forestry in the tropics. However, our current knowledge of the value of these habitats for biodiversity conservation is limited to very few taxa, and many studies are severely confounded by methodological shortcomings. We examined the conservation value of tropical primary, secondary, and plantation forests for 15 taxonomic groups using a robust and replicated sample design that minimized edge effects. Different taxa varied markedly in their response to patterns of land use in terms of species richness and the percentage of species restricted to primary forest (varying from 5{\%} to 57{\%}), yet almost all between-forest comparisons showed marked differences in community structure and composition. Cross-taxon congruence in response patterns was very weak when evaluated using abundance or species richness data, but much stronger when using metrics based upon community similarity. Our results show that, whereas the biodiversity indicator group concept may hold some validity for several taxa that are frequently sampled (such as birds and fruit-feeding butterflies), it fails for those exhibiting highly idiosyncratic responses to tropical land-use change (including highly vagile species groups such as bats and orchid bees), highlighting the problems associated with quantifying the biodiversity value of anthropogenic habitats. Finally, although we show that areas of native regeneration and exotic tree plantations can provide complementary conservation services, we also provide clear empirical evidence demonstrating the irreplaceable value of primary forests.},

abstract = {Multi-cohort-based forest management has been proposed as a strategy to conciliate wood supply and biodiversity conservation objectives. At the stand-level, the approach involves using partial harvesting to generate structurally complex stands, notably in terms of tree age, size and species mixtures, conditions that are not easily integrated into yield tables. Using SORTIE-ND, a spatially explicit stand dynamics model, we simulated 100-year development patterns following different partial harvesting treatments in two trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx)-dominated stands in eastern Canada, one 76-year old (pure aspen) and the other 90 years old (mixed aspen). The two stand types differed primarily in the nature of their understory: pure aspen stands had little advance conifer growth and a dense understory of a woody shrub species whereas mixed aspen stands were characterized by a dense regeneration layer of shade-tolerant conifers. To do this, we first evaluated model performance using short (12 years) and long (168 years) term empirical data. We then modelled stand dynamics following a range of simulated partial harvesting treatments of different intensities (33, 61 and 80{\%} basal area removal), and gap sizes (400, 900 and 1600m2). Following mortality of the first cohort of aspen, simulations projected dominance of conifer species, white spruce in particular, in unharvested controls of pure aspen stands and balsam fir in mixed aspen stands. Aspen recruitment increased with intensity of partial harvesting. All gap treatments and the 80{\%} dispersed harvesting favored recruitment of aspen over conifer species. After 100-year simulation runs, the 1600m2 gap treatment resulted in highest stand basal areas, 38.0 and 34.1m2ha−1, of which 18{\%} and 28{\%} consisted of intermediate- to shade-tolerant conifer species in pure aspen stands and in mixed aspen stands, respectively. Concerns surrounding partial harvesting have tended to focus on absolute retention levels and standing residence times of trees; however, our results demonstrate that both stand structure and timber production rates are influenced not only by retention levels after partial harvesting but also by spatial configuration of the residual trees. We identified several model functions that are likely responsible for divergences between empirical conditions and those simulated by SORTIE-ND for the boreal mixedwood and suggest specific empirical studies to improve parameter functions of this modelling tool.},

abstract = {Species distribution is strongly driven by local and global gradients in water availability but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Vulnerability to xylem embolism (P 50 ) is a key trait that indicates how species cope with drought and might explain plant distribution patterns across environmental gradients. Here we address its role on species sorting along a hydro-topographical gradient in a central Amazonian rainforest and examine its variance at the community scale. We measured P 50 for 28 tree species, soil properties and estimated the hydrological niche of each species using an indicator of distance to the water table (HAND). We found a large hydraulic diversity, covering as much as 44{\%} of the global angiosperm variation in P 50 . We show that P 50 : contributes to species segregation across a hydro-topographic gradient in the Amazon, and thus to species coexistence; is the result of repeated evolutionary adaptation within closely related taxa; is associated with species tolerance to P-poor soils, suggesting the evolution of a stress-tolerance syndrome to nutrients and drought; and is higher for trees in the valleys than uplands. The large observed hydraulic diversity and its association with topography has important implications for modelling and predicting forest and species resilience to climate change.},

* 2Light-saturated assimilation rate (Amass), leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf density, thickness, life span, saturated water content, chlorophyll, nitrogen and phosphorus content were determined during the wet season for 21 tree species in four contrasting habitats in northern Australia. Rainfall in this area is extremely seasonal.
* 3Amass and foliar chlorophyll, N and P contents were positively correlated with each other, and were all negatively correlated with LMA, leaf thickness, density and life span.
* 4Deciduous species had smaller LMA and leaf life span, and larger foliar N and P contents than did evergreen species.
* 5The eight Myrtaceous species had smaller Amass, foliar chlorophyll, N and P contents, and larger LMA, leaf thickness and leaf life span than did the non-Myrtaceous species.
* 6Leaves from the closed canopy dry monsoon forest had significantly larger Amass, chlorophyll and P contents than did leaves from the three open canopy habitats (eucalypt open forest, mixed woodland and Melaleuca swamp). This reflected the relatively low proportions of evergreen and Myrtaceous species in the dry monsoon forest. There were also significant intraspecific differences among habitats.
* 7Leaf thickness, density and LMA were lower than predicted from globally derived relationships with temperature and precipitation. Tropical seasonally dry biomes are under-represented in such global analyses.},

abstract = {Improving our understanding of species ranges under rapid climate change requires application of our knowledge of the tolerance and adaptive capacity of populations to changing environmental conditions. Here, we describe an emerging modelling approach, $\Delta$TraitSDM, which attempts to achieve this by explaining species distribution ranges based on phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation of fitness-related traits measured across large geographical gradients. The collection of intraspecific trait data measured in common gardens spanning broad environmental clines has promoted the development of these new models – first in trees but now rapidly expanding to other organisms. We review, explain and harmonize the main findings from this new generation of models that, by including trait variation over geographical scales, are able to provide new insights into future species ranges. Overall, $\Delta$TraitSDM predictions generally deliver a less alarming message than previous models of species distribution under new climates, indicating that phenotypic plasticity should help, to a considerable degree, some plant populations to persist under climate change. The development of $\Delta$TraitSDMs offers a new perspective to analyse intraspecific variation in single and multiple traits, with the rationale that trait (co)variation and consequently fitness can significantly change across geographical gradients and new climates.},

abstract = {Forest dynamic models predict the current and future states of ecosystems and are a nexus between physiological processes and empirical data, forest plot inventories and remote-sensing information. The problem of biodiversity representation in these models has long been an impediment to a detailed understanding of ecosystem processes. This challenge is amplified in species-rich and high-carbon tropical forests. Here we describe an individual-based and spatially-explicit forest growth simulator, TROLL, that integrates recent advances in plant physiology. Processes (carbon assimilation, allocation, reproduction and mortality) are linked to species-specific functional traits, and the model was parameterized for an Amazonian tropical rainforest. We simulated a forest regeneration experiment from bare soil, and we validated it against observations at our sites. Simulated forest regeneration compared well with observations for stem densities, gross primary productivity, aboveground biomass, and floristic composition. After 500 years of regrowth, the simulated forest displayed structural characteristics similar to observations (e.g. leaf area index and trunk diameter distribution). We then assessed the model's sensitivity to a number of key model parameters: light extinction coefficient and carbon quantum yield, and to a lesser extent mortality rate, and carbon allocation, all influenced ecosystem features. To illustrate the potential of the approach, we tested whether variation in species richness and composition influenced ecosystem properties. Overall, species richness had a positive effect on ecosystem processes, but this effect was controlled by the identity of species rather by richness per se. Also, functional trait community means had a stronger effect than functional diversity on ecosystem processes. TROLL should be applicable to many tropical forests sites, and data requirement is tailored to ongoing trait collection efforts. Such a model should foster the dialogue between ecology and the vegetation modeling community, help improve the predictive power of models, and eventually better inform policy choices.},

abstract = {While theoretical allometric models postulate universal scaling exponents, empirical relationships between tree dimensions show marked variability that reflects changes in the biomass allocation pattern. As growth of the various tree compartments may be controlled by different functions, it is hypothesized that they may respond differently to factors of variation, resulting in variable tree morphologies and potentially in trade-offs between allometric relationships. We explore the variability of tree stem and crown allometries using a dataset of 1,729 trees located in an undisturbed wet evergreen forest of the Western Ghats, India. We specifically test whether species adult stature, terrain slope, tree size and crown light exposure affect the relationships between stem diameter and stem height (stem allometry), and between stem diameter and crown width, crown area and crown volume (crown allometries). Results show that both stem and crown allometries are subject to variations in relation to both endogenous (tree size, species adult stature) and exogenous (terrain slope, crown light exposure) factors. Stem allometry appears to be more affected by these factors than are crown allometries, including the stem diameter-crown volume relationship, which proved to be particularly stable. Our results support the idea that height is a prevailing adjustment factor for a tree facing variable growth (notably light) conditions, while stem diameter-crown volume allometry responds more to internal metabolic constraints. We ultimately discuss the various sources of variability in the stem and crown allometries of tropical trees that likely play an important role in forest community dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Strong winds associated with severe convective storms are dominant natural drivers of treemortality in the Amazon.Why forests vary with respect to their vulnerability to wind events and how the predicted increase in storm eventsmight affect forest ecosystems within the Amazon are not well understood. We found that windthrows are common in the Amazon region extending fromnorthwest (Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, and west Brazil) to central Brazil, with the highest occurrence of windthrows in the northwest Amazon.More frequent winds, produced by more frequent severe convective systems, in combination with well-known processes that limit the anchoring of trees in the soil, help to explain the higher vulnerability of the northwest Amazon forests to winds. Projected increases in the frequency and intensity of convective storms in the Amazon have the potential to increase wind-related tree mortality. A forest demographic model calibrated for the northwestern and the central Amazon showed that northwestern forests aremore resilient to increased wind-related tree mortality than forests in the central Amazon. Our study emphasizes the importance of including wind-related treemortality inmodel simulations for reliable predictions of the future of tropical forests and their effects on the Earth' system.},

As a result of new empirical examples and theory, it is now generally accepted that sympatric speciation has occurred in at least a few instances, and is theoretically plausible. Instead, debate has shifted to whether sym- patric speciation is common, and whether models' assumptions are generally met in nature. The relative frequency of sympatric spe- ciation will be difficult to resolve, because biogeographic changes have obscured geographical patterns underlying many past specia- tion events. In contrast, progress is being made on evaluating the empirical validity of key theoretical conditions for sympatric spe- ciation. Disruptive selection and direct selection on mating traits, which should facilitate sympatric speciation, are biologically well supported. Conversely, costs to assortative mating are also widely documented, but inhibit speciation. Evaluating the joint incidence of these key factors may illuminate why sympatric speciation appears to be relatively uncommon.},

abstract = {Understanding the drivers of population divergence, speciation and species persistence is of great interest to molecular ecology, especially for species-rich radiations inhabiting the world's biodiversity hotspots. The toolbox of population genomics holds great promise for addressing these key issues, especially if genomic data are analyzed within a spatially and ecologically explicit context. We have studied the earliest stages of the divergence continuum in the Restionaceae, a species-rich and ecologically important plant family of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa, using the widespread CFR endemic Restio capensis (L.) H.P. Linder {\&} C.R. Hardy as an example. We studied diverging populations of this morphotaxon for plastid DNA sequences and {\textgreater}14 400 nuclear DNA polymorphisms from Restriction site Associated DNA (RAD) sequencing and analyzed the results jointly with spatial, climatic, and phytogeographic data, using a Bayesian generalized linear mixed modeling (GLMM) approach. The results indicate that population divergence across the extreme environmental mosaic of the CFR is mostly driven by isolation-by-environment (IBE) rather than isolation-by-distance (IBD) for both neutral and non-neutral markers, consistent with genome hitchhiking or coupling effects during early stages of divergence. Mixed modeling of plastid DNA and single divergent outlier loci from a Bayesian genome scan confirmed the predominant role of climate and pointed to additional drivers of divergence, such as drift and ecological agents of selection captured by phytogeographic zones. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of population genomics for disentangling the effects of IBD and IBE along the divergence continuum often found in species radiations across heterogeneous ecological landscapes.

abstract = {For a subdivided population the consequences of dominance and gene flow for the maintenance of multilocus polymorphism, local adaptation, and differentiation are investigated. The dispersing population inhabits two demes in which selection acts in opposite direction. Fitness is determined additively by two linked diallelic loci with arbitrary intermediate dominance (no over- or underdominance). For weak as well as strong migration, the equilibrium structure is derived. As a special case, a continuous-time continent-island model (CI model) is analyzed, with one-way migration from the continent to the island. For this CI model, the equilibrium and stability configuration is obtained explicitly for weak migration, for strong migration, for independent loci, and for complete linkage. For independent loci, the possible bifurcation patterns are derived as functions of the migration rate. These patterns depend strongly on the degree of dominance. The effects of dominance, linkage, and migration on the amount of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the degree of local adaptation are explored. Explicit formulas are obtained for D ( = x1x4 - x2x3) and r2 (the squared correlation in allelic state). They demonstrate that dominant island alleles increase D and decrease r2. Local adaptation is elevated by dominance of the locally adaptive alleles. The effective migration rate at a linked neutral locus is calculated. If advantageous alleles are dominant, it is decreased only slightly below the actual migration rate. For a quantitative trait that is determined by two additive loci, the influence of dominance on measures of differentiation is studied. Explicit expressions for Q S T and two types of F S T at equilibrium are deduced and their relation is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Diversification of ecology into subdisciplines that run from macroecology to landscape, community, and population ecology largely reflects its specialization on different segments of the spatial gradient over which recognizable ecological patterns and processes occur. In all these cases, the elemental units involved in the patterns and processes of interest to ecologists are individuals from the same or different species. No distinct flavor of ecology has yet emerged that focuses on patterns and processes revolving around the lowermost end of the spatial gradient, which in the case of plants corresponds to the within-individual domain. Intraindividual heterogeneity in organ traits, however, is quantitatively important and has multiple consequences for plant individuals, populations, and communities, and for animal consumers as well. This paper first provides an overview of current knowledge on plant traits that vary subindividually, the magnitude of subindividual variation, and its spatial patterning. Examples will then be presented on the consequences of subindividual variation for plants and animal consumers at individual, population, or community levels. Finally, the recently emerging links between genetics, epigenetics, subindividual variation, and population ecology will be illustrated using results on variation in seed size, a functional plant trait playing an important role in plant population dynamics. Further observational and experimental studies are needed which link ecological and phenotypic measurements of plants to their epigenetic and genetic characteristics, in order to understand the three-way relationships between subindividual variability, genetic features, and epigenetic mosaicism. Another proposed line of inquiry should focus on evaluating whether subindividual epigenetic mosaics eventually translate into epigenetically heterogeneous progeny, thus contributing to the maintenance of population and community functional diversity.},

abstract = {We use a two-species model of plant competition to explore the effect of intraspecific variation on community dynamics. The competitive ability ("performance") of each individual is assigned by an independent random draw from a species-specific probability distribution. If the density of individuals competing for open space is high (e.g., because fecundity is high), species with high maximum (or large variance in) performance are favored, while if density is low, species with high typical (e.g., mean) performance are favored. If there is an interspecific mean-variance performance trade-off, stable coexistence can occur across a limited range of intermediate densities, but the stabilizing effect of this trade-off appears to be weak. In the absence of this trade-off, one species is superior. In this case, intraspecific variation can blur interspecific differences (i.e., shift the dynamics toward what would be expected in the neutral case), but the strength of this effect diminishes as competitor density increases. If density is sufficiently high, the inferior species is driven to extinction just as rapidly as in the case where there is no overlap in performance between species. Intraspecific variation can facilitate coexistence, but this may be relatively unimportant in maintaining diversity in most real communities.},

abstract = {Abiotic factors such as climate and soil determine the species fundamental niche, which is further constrained by biotic interactions such as interspecific competition. To parameterize this realized niche, species distribution models (SDMs) most often relate species occurrence data to abiotic variables, but few SDM studies include biotic predictors to help explain species distributions. Therefore, most predictions of species distributions under future climates assume implicitly that biotic interactions remain constant or exert only minor influence on large-scale spatial distributions, which is also largely expected for species with high competitive ability. We examined the extent to which variance explained by SDMs can be attributed to abiotic or biotic predictors and how this depends on species traits. We fit generalized linear models for 11 common tree species in Switzerland using three different sets of predictor variables: biotic, abiotic, and the combination of both sets. We used variance partitioning to estimate the proportion of the variance explained by biotic and abiotic predictors, jointly and independently. Inclusion of biotic predictors improved the SDMs substantially. The joint contribution of biotic and abiotic predictors to explained deviance was relatively small ( 9{\%}) compared to the contribution of each predictor set individually ( 20{\%} each), indicating that the additional information on the realized niche brought by adding other species as predictors was largely independent of the abiotic (topo-climatic) predictors. The influence of biotic predictors was relatively high for species preferably growing under low disturbance and low abiotic stress, species with long seed dispersal distances, species with high shade tolerance as juveniles and adults, and species that occur frequently and are dominant across the landscape. The influence of biotic variables on SDM performance indicates that community composition and other local biotic factors or abiotic processes not included in the abiotic predictors strongly influence prediction of species distributions. Improved prediction of species' potential distributions in future climates and communities may assist strategies for sustainable forest management.},

abstract = {1. Phylogenetic signal is the tendency of related species to resemble each other more than species drawn at randomfrom the same tree. This pattern is of considerable interest in a range of ecological and evolutionary research areas, and various indices have been proposed for quantifying it. Unfortunately, these indices often lead to contrasting results, and guidelines for choosing the most appropriate index are lacking. 2. Here, we compare the performance of four commonly used indices using simulated data. Data were generated with numerical simulations of trait evolution along phylogenetic trees under a variety of evolutionary models. We investigated the sensitivity of the approaches to the size of phylogenies, the resolution of tree structure and the availability of branch length information, examining both the response of the selected indices and the power of the associated statistical tests. 3. We found that under a Brownian motion (BM) model of trait evolution, Abouheif's Cmean and Pagel's $\lambda$ performed well and substantially better than Moran's I and Blomberg's K. Pagel's $\lambda$ provided a reliable effect size measure and performed better for discriminating between more complex models of trait evolution, but was computationally more demanding than Abouheif's Cmean. Blomberg's K was most suitable to capture the effects of changing evolutionary rates in simulation experiments. 4. Interestingly, sample size influenced not only the uncertainty but also the expected values of most indices, while polytomies and missing branch length information had only negligible impacts. 5. We propose guidelines for choosing among indices, depending on (a) their sensitivity to true underlying patterns of phylogenetic signal, (b) whether a test or a quantitative measure is required and (c) their sensitivities to different topologies of phylogenies. 6. These guidelines aimto better assess phylogenetic signal and distinguish it fromrandom trait distributions. They were developed under the assumption of BM, and additional simulations with more complex trait evolution models show that they are to a certain degree generalizable. They are particularly useful in comparative analyses, when requiring a proxy for niche similarity, and in conservation studies that explore phylogenetic loss associated with extinction risks of specific clades. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {The relationships between resource availabili- ty, plant succession, and species' life history traits are often considered key to understanding variation among species and communities. Leaf lifespan is one trait im- portant in this regard. We observed that leaf lifespan varies 30-fold among 23 species from natural and dis- turbed communities within a 1-km radius in the northern Amazon basin, near San Carlos de Rio Negro, Venezue- la. Moreover, leaf lifespan was highly correlated with a number of important leaf structural and functional characteristics. Stomatal conductance to water vapor (g) and both mass and area-based net photosynthesis de- creased with increasing leaf lifespan (r2 = 0.74, 0.91 and 0.75, respectively). Specific leaf area (SLA) also de- creased with increasing leaf lifespan (r2 = 0.78), while leaf toughness increased (r2 = 0.62). Correlations between leaf lifespan and leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concen- trations were moderate on a weight basis and not signifi- cant on an area basis. On an absolute basis, changes in SLA, net photosynthesis and leaf chemistry were large as leaf lifespan varied from 1.5 to 12 months, but such changes were small as leaf lifespan increased from 1 to 5 years. Mass-based net photosynthesis (A/mass) was highly correlated with SLA (r2 = 0.90) and mass-based leaf nitrogen (N/mass) (r2 = 0.85), but area-based net photosynthesis (A/area) was not well correlated with any index of leaf structure or chemistry including N/area. Overall, these results indicate that species allocate re- sources towards a high photosynthetic assimilation rate for a brief time, or provide resistant physical structure that results in a lower rate of carbon assimilation over a longer time, but not both.

abstract = {Two decades of research have not established whether tropical insect herbivores are dominated by specialists or generalists. This impedes our understanding of species coexistence in diverse rainforest communities. Host specificity and species richness of tropical insects are also key parameters in mapping global patterns of biodiversity. Here we analyse data for over 900 herbivorous species feeding on 51 plant species in New Guinea and show that most herbivorous species feed on several closely related plant species. Because species-rich genera are dominant in tropical floras, monophagous herbivores are probably rare in tropical forests. Furthermore, even between phylogenetically distant hosts, herbivore communities typically shared a third of their species. These results do not support the classical view that the coexistence of herbivorous species in the tropics is a consequence of finely divided plant resources; non-equilibrium models of tropical diversity should instead be considered. Low host specificity of tropical herbivores reduces global estimates of arthropod diversity from 31 million (ref. 1) to 4 6 million species. This finding agrees with estimates based on taxonomic collections, reconciling an order of magnitude discrepancy between extrapolations of global diversity based on ecological samples of tropical communities with those based on sampling regional faunas.},

abstract = {Understanding speciation is a fundamental biological problem. It is believed that many species originated through allopatric divergence, where new species arise from geographically isolated populations of the same ancestral species. In contrast, the possibility of sympatric speciation (in which new species arise without geographical isolation) has often been dismissed, partly because of theoretical difficulties. Most previous models analysing sympatric speciation concentrated on particular aspects of the problem while neglecting others. Here we present a model that integrates a novel combination of different features and show that sympatric speciation is a likely outcome of competition for resources. We use multilocus genetics to describe sexual reproduction in an individual-based model, and we consider the evolution of assortative mating (where individuals mate preferentially with like individuals) depending either on an ecological character affecting resource use or on a selectively neutral marker trait. In both cases, evolution of assortative mating often leads to reproductive isolation between ecologically diverging subpopulations. When assortative mating depends on a marker trait, and is therefore not directly linked to resource competition, speciation occurs when genetic drift breaks the linkage equilibrium between the marker and the ecological trait. Our theory conforms well with mounting empirical evidence for the sympatric origin of many species.},

However, hybridization has rarely been demonstrated among tree species in Amazonia, the world's largest rainforest, and its role in diversification remains enigmatic. We show that within Brownea, a characteristic tree genus of Amazonia, there is extensive evidence of hybridization. Using both phylogenomic and population genomic approaches we find multiple historical hybridization events within Brownea, along with contemporary hybridization among co-occurring species. Finally, we infer homogeneous rates of gene flow among different genomic loci, indicating a lack of selection against hybrids, reflecting their persistence over time. These results demonstrate that gene flow between Amazonian tree species has occurred across temporal scales, which contrasts with previous work on Amazonian trees, and may have contributed to the evolution of the most diverse tree flora on Earth.},

We use predictors extracted from the Canopy Height Model to compare models of varying complexity: single or multiple regressions and nested models that predict BA by independent estimates of stem density and quadratic mean diameter. Direct multiple regression was the most accurate, giving a 9.6{\%} Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction (RMSEP). The magnitude of the various errors introduced during the data collection stage is evaluated and their contribution to MSEP is analyzed. It was found that these errors accounted for less than 10{\%} of model MSEP, suggesting that there is considerable scope for model improvement. Although site-specific models showed lower MSEP than global models, stratification by site may not be the optimal solution. The key to future improvement would appear to lie in a stratification that captures variations in relations between LiDAR and forest structure. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

We investigated relationships between trait heritabilities, additive genetic variances, and traits' contribution to lifetime reproductive success (≈fitness) in a red-billed gull (Larus novaehollandiae) population making use of animal model analyses as applied to 15 female and 13 male traits. We found that the traits closely associated with fitness tended to have lower heritabilities than traits less closely associated with fitness. However, in contrast with the results of earlier studies in the wild, the low heritability of the fitness-related traits was not only due to their high residual variance, but also due to their low additive genetic variance. Permanent environment effects - integrating environmental effects experienced in early life as well as nonadditive genetic effects - on many traits were large, but unrelated to traits' importance for fitness. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Individual-based forest models (IBMs) are useful to investigate the effect of environment on forest structure and dynamics, but they are often restricted to site-specific applications. To build confidence for spatially distributed simulations, model transferability, i.e. the ability of the same model to provide reliable predictions at contrasting sites, has to be thoroughly tested. We tested the transferability of a spatially explicit forest IBM, TROLL, with a trait-based species parameterization and global gridded climate forcing, by applying it to two sites with sharply contrasting climate and floristic compositions across the tropics, one in South America and one in Southeast Asia. We identified which parameters are most influential for model calibration and assessed the model sensitivity to climatic conditions for a given calibration. TROLL produced realistic predictions of forest structure and dynamics at both sites and this necessitates the recalibration of only three parameters, namely photosynthesis efficiency, crown allometry and mortality rate. All three relate to key processes that constrain model transferability and warrant further model development and data acquisition, with mortality being a particular priority of improvement for the current generation of vegetation models. Varying the climatic conditions at both sites demonstrate similar, and expected, model responses: GPP increased with temperature and irradiance, while stem density and aboveground biomass declined as temperature increased. The climate dependence of productivity and biomass was mediated by plant respiration, carbon allocation and mortality, which has implications both on model development and on forecasting of future carbon dynamics. Our detailed examination of forest IBM transferability unveils key processes that need to improve in genericity before reliable large-scale implementations can be envisioned.},

In addition, well-resolved molecular phylogenies derived from these DNA barcode sequences have the potential to improve investigations of the mechanisms underlying community assembly and functional trait evolution. To date, no studies have effectively applied DNA barcodes sensu strictu in this manner.

These DNA barcode sequences are also used to reconstruct a robust community phylogeny employing a supermatrix method for 281 of the 296 plant species in the plot. The three-locus barcode data were sufficient to reliably reconstruct evolutionary relationships among the plant taxa in the plot that are congruent with the broadly accepted phylogeny of flowering plants (APG II). Earlier work on the phylogenetic structure of the BCI forest dynamics plot employing less resolved phylogenies reveals significant differences in evolutionary and ecological inferences compared with our data and suggests that unresolved community phylogenies may have increased type I and type II errors. These results illustrate how highly resolved phylogenies based on DNA barcode sequence data will enhance research focused on the interface between community ecology and evolution.},

abstract = {1. Amazonian droughts are predicted to become increasingly frequent and intense, and the vulnerability of Amazonian trees has become increasingly documented. However, little is known about the physiological mechanisms and the diversity of drought tolerance of tropical trees due to the lack of quantitative measurements. 2. Leaf water potential at wilting or turgor loss point ($\pi$tlp) is a determinant of the tolerance of leaves to drought stress, and contributes to plant-level physiological drought tolerance. Recently, it has been demonstrated that leaf osmotic water potential at full hydration ($\pi$0) is tightly correlated with $\pi$tlp. Estimating $\pi$tlp from osmometer measurements of $\pi$0 is much faster than the standard pressure-volume curve approach of $\pi$tlp determination. We used this technique to estimate $\pi$tlp for 165 trees of 71 species, at three sites within forests in French Guiana. Our dataset represents a significant increase in available data for this trait for tropical tree species. 3. Tropical trees showed a wider range of drought tolerance than previously found in the literature, $\pi$tlp ranging from -1.4 to -3.2 MPa. This range likely corresponds in part to adaptation and acclimation to occasionally extreme droughts during the dry season. 4. Leaf-level drought tolerance varied across species, in agreement with the available published observations of species variation in drought-induced mortality. On average, species with a more negative $\pi$tlp (i.e., with greater leaf-level drought tolerance) occurred less frequently across the region than drought-sensitive species. 5. Across individuals, $\pi$tlp correlated positively but weakly with leaf toughness (R2=0.22, Accepted Article P=0.04) and leaf thickness (R2=0.03, P=0.03). No correlation was detected with other functional traits (leaf mass per area, leaf area, nitrogen or carbon concentrations, carbon isotope ratio, sapwood density or bark thickness). 6. The variability in $\pi$tlp among species indicates a potential for highly diverse species responses to drought within given forest communities. Given the weak correlations between $\pi$tlp and traditionally measured plant functional traits, vegetation models seeking to predict forest response to drought should integrate improved quantification of comparative drought tolerance among tree species},

abstract = {Despite striking differences in climate, soils, and evolutionary history among diverse biomes ranging from tropical and temperate forests to alpine tundra and desert, we found similar interspecific relationships among leaf structure and function and plant growth in all biomes. Our results thus demonstrate convergent evolution and global generality in plant functioning, despite the enormous diversity of plant species and biomes. For 280 plant species from two global data sets, we found that potential carbon gain (photosynthesis) and carbon loss (respiration) increase in similar proportion with decreasing leaf life-span, increasing leaf nitrogen concentra-tion, and increasing leaf surface area-to-mass ratio. Produc-tivity of individual plants and of leaves in vegetation canopies also changes in constant proportion to leaf life-span and surface area-to-mass ratio. These global plant functional relationships have significant implications for global scale modeling of vegetation–atmosphere CO 2 exchange. Enormous interspecific variation in plant traits has been observed, with growth rate, photosynthesis, respiration, leaf life-span, leaf nitrogen, and specific leaf area (SLA) (a mea-sure of leaf surface area per unit mass) varying 10-to 100-fold among species (1–5). Such variation is thought to represent adaptations to the range of environmental conditions that occur in habitats as divergent as alpine tundra, desert, and tropical rain forest. However, if combinations of plant func-tional characteristics recur repeatedly in distantly related taxa across a broad geographic range, it would indicate that nature's selective forces constrain the collective traits that exist in any species (5, 6). Here, we test the hypothesis (5, 6) that variation in plant traits is highly constrained, with all plant species having traits that fall at some point on a universal tradeoff surface. To test this hypothesis, we quantified net photosyn-thesis, other leaf traits, and their interrelationships in the field for 111 species of terrestrial higher plants from six biomes that vary widely in climate (Fig. 1). Leaf trait data were collected for 111 tree, shrub, and herbaceous C 3 species (10–43 per region) in the following biomes: lowland tropical rain forest in Venezuela, subtropical coastal plain forest in South Carolina; montane cool temperate forest in North Carolina; desert͞ shrubland in New Mexico; cold temperate forest, bog, and prairie in Wisconsin; and alpine tundra͞subalpine forest in Colorado. These regions differ tremendously in climate, with mean annual temperature varying from Ϫ3 to 26°C, mean annual precipitation from 220 to 3500 mm, and elevation from 4 to 3500 m. Hence, the study areas span a broad range of vegetation types and almost the entire range of climates in which terrestrial plants grow (Fig. 1). Study species were chosen to span the range of leaf traits common in each biome (Table 1) based on a priori knowledge of the sites and their species. For young, mature leaves of each species, light-saturated net photosynthetic capacity (A max) and leaf diffusive conductance were measured in the field (7–9) under ambient CO 2 concentrations and SLA (projected leaf area per dry mass), dark respiration (at 25°C), and N concen-tration of those leaves were assessed, on both mass and area bases. Average leaf life-span (month ϭ 30.4 days) was assessed for each species in the field, from long term monitoring of numerous leaves and͞or phenological observation. Field data on leaf, plant, and ecosystem characteristics also were com-piled from the literature for species from several continents and an equally broad array of biomes. Log (base 10) transfor-mations of the data were required to normalize the data distribution, linearize the regression functions, and stabilize the error term variances. In addition to necessary statistical reasons, leaf trait relationships were quantified using power functions of the form log y ϭ a ϩ b log(x) because of their common application in biological scaling studies (5, 10, 11). Thus, the dependent variable changes as y ϰ x},

Recent improvements in plant growth modelling have allowed deeper understanding and more accurate predictions for a wide range of ecological issues, including competition among plants, plant-herbivore interactions and ecosystem functioning. 2.One challenge in modelling plant growth is that, for a variety of reasons, relative growth rate (RGR) almost universally decreases with increasing size, although traditional calculations assume that RGR is constant. Nonlinear growth models are flexible enough to account for varying growth rates. 3.We demonstrate a variety of nonlinear models that are appropriate for modelling plant growth and, for each, show how to calculate function-derived growth rates, which allow unbiased comparisons among species at a common time or size. We show how to propagate uncertainty in estimated parameters to express uncertainty in growth rates. Fitting nonlinear models can be challenging, so we present extensive worked examples and practical recommendations, all implemented in R. 4.The use of nonlinear models coupled with function-derived growth rates can facilitate the testing of novel hypotheses in population and community ecology. For example, the use of such techniques has allowed better understanding of the components of RGR, the costs of rapid growth and the linkage between host and parasite growth rates. We hope this contribution will demystify nonlinear modelling and persuade more ecologists to use these techniques. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

Understanding their evolution, distribution and impact on vein–stomata–climate associations is an important contribution to our global view of vein network organization. Based on vein traits of 55 species of pantropical Ochnaceae, stomata and climatic niche data, and a dated molecular phylogeny, we unveil major structural shifts in vein networks through deep time, relationships between leaf size, vein and stomata traits, and their interplay with climate. Dense 2° veins, reduction of minor veins and the associated breakdown of vein–leaf size scaling evolved multiple times independently in Ochnaceae. In spite of the drastic changes in vein architecture in this venation type, vein and stomatal densities remain correlated. Our study demonstrates that shortening the major vein–stomata distance is economically not less advantageous than by increasing minor vein density, as illustrated by the same degree of coordination between vein and stomatal densities and the similar construction costs across networks with dense 2° veins and those with ‘normally' spaced 2° veins.},

abstract = {Reconstructing species trees from multi-loci datasets is becoming a standard practice in phylogenetics. Nevertheless, access to high-throughput sequencing may be costly, especially with studies of many samples. The potential high cost makes a priori assessments desirable in order to make informed decisions about sequencing. We generated twelve transcriptomes for ten species of the Brazil nut family (Lecythidaceae), identified a set of putatively orthologous nuclear loci and evaluated, in silico, their phylogenetic utility using genome skimming data of 24 species. We designed the markers using MarkerMiner, and developed a script, GoldFinder, to efficiently sub-select the best makers for sequencing. We captured, in silico, all designed 354 nuclear loci and performed a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis on the concatenated sequence matrix. We also calculated individual gene trees with maximum likelihood and used them for a coalescent-based species tree inference. Both analyses resulted in almost identical topologies. However, our nuclear-loci phylogenies were strongly incongruent with a published plastome phylogeny, suggesting that plastome data alone is not sufficient for species tree estimation. Our results suggest that using hundreds of nuclear markers (i.e. 354) will significantly improve the Lecythidaceae species tree. The framework described here will be useful, generally, for developing markers for species tree inference.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms.

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Modelling growth strategies among tropical trees is an important objective in predicting the response of tree dynamics to selective logging and in gaining insights into the ecological processes that structure tree communities in managed tropical forests. 2. We developed a disturbance index to model the effects of distance to and area of logging gaps on stem radial growth rates. This index was tested using census data of 43 neotropical tree species, representing a variety of life-history strategies and developmental stages, from a selectively logged forest at Paracou, French Guiana. Growth strategies were analyzed in light of two indicators: the inherent species growth rate (when disturbance index is null) and the species reaction (change in growth rate) to logging gaps. 3. Across species, the predicted inherent growth rates in unlogged forest ranged from 0 center dot 25 to 6 center dot 47 mm year-1, with an average growth of 2 center dot 29 mm year-1. Ontogenetic shifts in inherent growth rate were found in 26 of the 43 species. 4. Species growth response to logging gaps varied widely among species but was significantly positive for 27 species. The effect of ontogeny on growth response to logging was retained for 14 species, and species with inherent fast growth rate (5 mm year-1) responded less to logging gap disturbances than did species with slow inherent growth (1 mm year-1). 5. Functional traits explained 19-42{\%} of the variation in the inherent growth rate and in species' response across all developmental stages. Whereas maximum diameters and seed mass were strong predictors of inherent growth rate, maximum height, wood density, mode of germination and stem architecture were additionally involved in tree growth response. 6. Synthesis and applications: This study provides a necessary framework for developing predictive post-logging growth models for the thousands of species comprising tropical forests and is sufficiently general to apply to a broad range of managed tropical forests.},

abstract = {Most forests today are multi-specific and heterogeneous forests ('mixed forests'). However, forest modelling has been focusing on mono-specific stands for a long time, only recently have models been developed for mixed forests. Previous reviews of mixed forest modelling were restricted to certain categories of models only and were generally not considering application and suitability. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the models designed for or applied to modelling mixed forest growth and dynamics and to review the suitability of the different model types according to their intended purposes. The first part of the paper gives an overview of previous classifications, after which a new and overall classification scheme is presented. Next, the characteristics of the six modelling approaches that were distinguished are described: distance-dependent stand models, distribution models, average tree models, distance-dependent tree models, distance-independent tree models and gap models. All, except gap models, are close to mono-specific stands modelling approaches. The second part of the paper describes the main applications of these modelling approaches and presents a critical analysis of their suitability. Applications can be separated between growth and yield studies and forest dynamics simulation studies. Attention must be paid to recruitment sub-models, which appear to be inadequate in many models, but which highly influence the simulation outcome. All types of model were used as management tools. Stand level simulations fit the yield data better than tree level simulations, as a result of cumulated model errors from tree to stand level. However, tree level approaches seem most appropriate to understand stand growth as affected by competition between individuals of different species. Forest dynamics were mostly modelled using distribution models, gap models and distance-dependent tree models. The latter appeared to be less suitable because of the difficulties in modelling 3D stand structure over large periods and areas. Gap models could be applied to larger areas and time periods than distribution models, especially when they included detailed descriptions of the ecological functioning of the ecosystem. In sum the empirical models appeared more accurate in their predictions than mechanistic models, but they are highly dependent on the data used for parameterisation. That makes them unsuitable for extrapolation to other systems or conditions. Although mechanistic models can also be misused, adding mechanistic approaches to empirical observations is necessary to model the growth and dynamics of complex forest systems. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {* Climate change is expected to increase the magnitude and the frequency of extreme climatic events such as droughts. Better understanding how plant communities will respond to these droughts is a major challenge. We expect the response to be a shift in functional trait values resulting from both species turnover and intraspecific trait variability, but little research has addressed the relative contribution of both components. * We analysed the short-term functional response of subalpine grassland communities to a simulated drought by focusing on four leaf traits (LDMC: leaf dry matter content, SLA: specific leaf area, LNC: leaf nitrogen concentration and LCC: leaf carbon concentration). After evaluating species turnover and intraspecific variability separately, we determined their relative contribution in the community functional response to drought, reflected by changes in community-weighted mean traits. * We found significant species turnover and intraspecific variability, as well as significant changes in community-weighted mean for most of the traits. The relative contribution of intraspecific variability to the changes in community mean traits was more important (42–99{\%}) than the relative contribution of species turnover (1–58{\%}). Intraspecific variability either amplified (for LDMC, SLA and LCC) or dampened (for LNC) the community functional response mediated by species turnover. We demonstrated that the small contribution of species turnover to the changes in community mean LDMC and LCC was explained by a lack of covariation between species turnover and interspecific trait differences. * Synthesis. These results highlight the need for a better consideration of intraspecific variability to understand and predict the effect of climate change on plant communities. While both species turnover and intraspecific variability can be expected following an extreme drought, we report new evidence that intraspecific variability can be a more important driver of the short-term functional response of plant communities.},

abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity in environmental conditions has led to adaptive genetic differentiation and the development of home-site fitness advantage (local adaptation) among populations of many widespread plant species such as forest trees. Although its overall patterns have been well characterised, earlier studies on adaptation have predominantly used long-term averages of environmental variables to describe local climates. Subsequently, only little is currently known about more complex patterns of variation in potential selective forces and how they affect adaptive processes. Furthermore, we also lack a good understanding of why adaptive traits often vary within populations despite clear evidence of local selection. Because the capacity of a population to respond to changes in its home environment depends on the amount of genetic variation that it contains, an understanding of these patterns is fundamental to predicting how extant populations will cope with climate change. In this paper, I call attention to these two issues and discuss adaptation in heterogeneous environments using studies mainly on Finnish populations of Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.) as an example. In this geographic area, population means in growth cessation are closely related to the latitude at the population's home site, indicating adaptation to local environments. Yet the trait varies considerably also within populations, with the highest levels of phenotypic variation found in the central part of the latitudinal gradient. Increased variation further north may have a significant genetic component. In stable local environments this would indicate that populations with less variation are more optimally adapted to their home site environments. On the other hand, climate data show that growing season temperature conditions within Finland become temporally more variable towards the north which might contribute to different levels of trait variation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the weaknesses of focusing only on long-term averages of environmental variables or trait means when examining adaptation in natural populations. Moreover, better integrated analyses of both genetic and environmental variation might help in disentangling the mechanisms that maintain adaptive genetic diversity and adaptive capacity in natural populations of perennial species under changing environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) are ge-netic markers whose precise identification is a pre-requisite for association studies. Methods to iden-tify them are currently well developed for model species, but rely on the availability of a (good) reference genome, and therefore cannot be ap-plied to non-model species. They are also mostly tailored for whole genome (re-)sequencing experi-ments, whereas in many cases, transcriptome se-quencing can be used as a cheaper alternative which already enables to identify SNPs located in tran-scribed regions. In this paper, we propose a method that identifies, quantifies and annotates SNPs with-out any reference genome, using RNA-seq data only. Individuals can be pooled prior to sequencing, if not enough material is available from one individual. Us-ing pooled human RNA-seq data, we clarify the pre-cision and recall of our method and discuss them with respect to other methods which use a reference genome or an assembled transcriptome.

abstract = {Species loss can impact ecosystem functioning, but no general framework for analyzing these impacts exists. Here I derive a general partitioning of the effects of species loss on any ecosystem function comprising the summed contributions of individual species (e.g., primary productivity). The approach partitions the difference in ecosystem function between two sites (a "pre-loss" site, and a "post-loss" site comprising a strict subset of the species at the pre-loss site) into additive components attributable to different effects. The approach does not assume a particular experimental design or require monoculture data, making it more general than previous approaches. Using the Price Equation from evolutionary biology, I show that three distinct effects cause ecosystem function to vary between sites: the "species richness effect" (SRE; random loss of species richness), the "species composition effect" (SCE; nonrandom loss of high- or low-functioning species), and the "context dependence effect" (CDE; post-loss changes in the functioning of the remaining species). The SRE reduces ecosystem function without altering mean function per species. The SCE is analogous to natural selection in evolution. Nonrandom loss of, for example, high-functioning species will reduce mean function per species, and thus total function, just as selection against large individuals in an evolving population reduces mean body size in the next generation. The CDE is analogous to imperfect transmission in evolution. For instance, any factor (e.g., an environmental change) causing offspring to attain smaller body sizes than their parents (imperfect transmission) will reduce the mean body size in the next generation. Analogously, any factor causing the species remaining at the post-loss site to make smaller functional contributions than at the pre-loss site will reduce mean function per species, and thus total function. I use published data to illustrate how this new partition generalizes previous approaches, facilitates comparative analyses, and generates new empirical insights. In particular, the SCE often is less important than other effects.},

abstract = {Both linear mixed models (LMMs) and sparse regression models are widely used in genetics applications, including, recently, polygenic modeling in genome-wide association studies. These two approaches make very different assumptions, so are expected to perform well in different situations. However, in practice, for a given data set one typically does not know which assumptions will be more accurate. Motivated by this, we consider a hybrid of the two, which we refer to as a "Bayesian sparse linear mixed model" (BSLMM) that includes both these models as special cases. We address several key computational and statistical issues that arise when applying BSLMM, including appropriate prior specification for the hyper-parameters, and a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference. We apply BSLMM and compare it with other methods for two polygenic modeling applications: estimating the proportion of variance in phenotypes explained (PVE) by available genotypes, and phenotype (or breeding value) prediction. For PVE estimation, we demonstrate that BSLMM combines the advantages of both standard LMMs and sparse regression modeling. For phenotype prediction it considerably outperforms either of the other two methods, as well as several other large-scale regression methods previously suggested for this problem. Software implementing our method is freely available from http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/software.html},

abstract = {Tropical forests hold large stores of carbon, yet uncertainty remains regarding their quantitative contribution to the global carbon cycle. One approach to quantifying carbon biomass stores consists in inferring changes from long-term forest inventory plots. Regression models are used to convert inventory data into an estimate of aboveground biomass (AGB). We provide a critical reassessment of the quality and the robustness of these models across tropical forest types, using a large dataset of 2,410 trees ! 5 cm. diameter, directly harvested in 27 study sites across the tropics. Proportional relationships between aboveground biomass and the product of wood density, trunk cross-sectional area, and total height are constructed. We also develop a regression model involving wood density and stem diameter only. Our models were tested for secondary and old-growth forests, for dry, moist and wet forests, for lowland and montane forests, and for mangrove forests. The most important predictors of AGB of a tree were, in decreasing order of importance, its trunk diameter, wood specific gravity, total height, and forest type (dry, moist, or wet). Overestimates prevailed, giving a bias of 0.5-6.5{\%} when errors were averaged across all stands. Our regression models can be used reliably to predict aboveground tree biomass across a broad range of tropical forests. Because they are based on an unprecedented dataset, these models should improve the quality of tropical biomass estimates, and bring consensus about the contribution of the tropical forest biome and tropical deforestation to the global carbon cycle.},

Since WGS is unquestionably becoming a new foundation for molecular analyses, we decided to compare three currently used tools for variant calling of human whole genome sequencing data. We tested DeepVariant, a new TensorFlow machine learning-based variant caller, and compared this tool to GATK 4.0 and SpeedSeq, using 30×, 15× and 10× WGS data of the well-known NA12878 DNA reference sample. According to our comparison, the performance on SNV calling was almost similar in 30× data, with all three variant callers reaching F-Scores (i.e. harmonic mean of recall and precision) equal to 0.98. In contrast, DeepVariant was more precise in indel calling than GATK and SpeedSeq, as demonstrated by F-Scores of 0.94, 0.90 and 0.84, respectively. We conclude that the DeepVariant tool has great potential and usefulness for analysis of WGS data in medical genetics.},

abstract = {Canopy height is a key variable in tropical forest functioning and for regional carbon inventories. We investigate the spatial structure of the canopy height of a tropical forest, its relationship with environmental physical covariates, and the implication for tropical forest height variation mapping. Making use of high-resolution maps of LiDAR-derived Digital Canopy Model (DCM) and environmental covariates from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) acquired over 30,000 ha of tropical forest in French Guiana, we first show that forest canopy height is spatially correlated up to 2500 m. Forest canopy height is significantly associated with environmental variables, but the degree of correlation varies strongly with pixel resolution. On the whole, bottomland forests generally have lower canopy heights than hillslope or hilltop forests. However, this global picture is very noisy at local scale likely because of the endogenous gap-phase forest dynamic processes. Forest canopy height has been predictively mapped across a pixel resolution going from 6 m to 384 m mimicking a low resolution case of 3 points˙km2. Results of canopy height mapping indicated that the error for spatial model with environment effects decrease from 8.7 m to 0.91 m, depending of the pixel resolution. Results suggest that, outside the calibration plots, the contribution of environment in shaping the global canopy height distribution is quite limited. This prevents accurate canopy height mapping based only on environmental information, and suggests that precise canopy height maps, for local management purposes, can only be obtained with direct LiDAR monitoring.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 British Ecological Society. Understanding the role of competition in structuring communities requires that we quantify competitive ability in a way that permits us to predict the outcome of competition over the long term. Given such a clear goal for a process that has been the focus of ecological research for decades, there is surprisingly little consensus on how to measure competitive ability, with up to 50 different metrics currently proposed. Using competitive population dynamics as a foundation, we define competitive ability-the ability of one species to exclude another-using quantitative theoretical models of population dynamics to isolate the key parameters that are known to predict competitive outcomes. Based on the definition of competitive ability we identify the empirical requirements and describe straightforward methods for quantifying competitive ability in future empirical studies. In doing so, our analysis also allows us to identify why many existing approaches to studying competition are unsuitable for quantifying competitive ability. Synthesis. Competitive ability is precisely defined starting from models of competitive population dynamics. Quantifying competitive ability in a theoretically justified manner is straightforward using experimental designs readily applied to studies of competition in the laboratory and field.},

abstract = {The leaf economics spectrum is a general concept describing coordinated variation in foliage structural, chemical and physiological traits across resource gradients. Yet, within this concept, the role of within-species variation, including ecotypic and plastic variation components, has been largely neglected. This study hypothesized that there is a within-species economics spectrum within the general spectrum in the evergreen sclerophyll Quercus ilex which dominates low resource ecosystems over an exceptionally wide range. An extensive database of foliage traits covering the full species range was constructed, and improved filtering algorithms were developed. Standardized data filtering was deemed absolutely essential as additional variation sources can result in trait variation of 10–300{\%},blurring the broad relationships. Strong trait variation, c. two-fold for most traits to up to almost an order of magnitude, was uncovered. Although the Q. ilex spectrum is part of the general spectrum, within-species trait and climatic relationships in this species partly differed from the overall spectrum. Contrary to world-wide trends, Q. ilex does not necessarily have a low nitrogen content per mass and can increase photosynthetic capacity with increasing foliage robustness. This study argues that the withinspecies economics spectrum needs to be considered in regional- to biome-level analyses.},

abstract = {AimsSpatial distribution patterns of species reflect not only the ecological processes but also the habitat features that are related to species distribution. In karst topography, species distribution patterns provide more specific information about their environments. The objectives of this study are as follows: (i) to analyse and explain the spatial distribution patterns of conspecific trees in an old-growth subtropical karst forest; (ii) to investigate pattern changes at different spatial scales; (iii) to test the spatial pattern similarity (or dissimilarity) between trees at different abundances, diameter at breast height classes, canopy layers and different functional groups (shade tolerance and seed dispersal mode); (iv) to examine whether habitat heterogeneity has an important effect on the species spatial distribution. MethodsThe spatial distributions of woody species with [{\&}ge;]20 individuals in a 1-ha subtropical karst forest plot at Maolan in southwestern China were quantified using the relative neighbourhood density {\{}Omega{\}} based on the average density of conspecific species in a circular neighbourhood around each species. Important FindingsAggregated distribution is the dominant pattern in the karst forest, but the ratio of aggregated species in total species number decreases with an increase in spatial scale. Less abundant species are more aggregated than most abundant species. Aggregation is weaker in larger diameter classes, which is consistent with the prediction of self-thinning. Seed dispersal mode influences spatial patterns, with species dispersed by animals being less aggregated than those dispersed by wind and gravity. Other species functional traits (e.g. shade tolerance) also influence the species spatial distributions. Moreover, differences among species habitat associations, e.g. with rocky outcrops, play a significant role in species spatial distributions. These results indicate that habitat heterogeneity, seed dispersal limitation and self-thinning primarily contribute to the species spatial distributions in this subtropical karst forest.},

abstract = {Both local- and landscape-scale processes drive succession of secondary forests in human-modified tropical landscapes. Nonetheless, until recently successional changes in composition and diversity have been predominantly studied at the patch level. Here, we used a unique dataset with 45 randomly selected sites across a mixed-use tropical landscape in central Panama to study forest succession simultaneously on local and landscape scales and across both life stages (seedling, sapling, juvenile and adult trees) and life forms (shrubs, trees, lianas, and palms). To understand the potential of these secondary forests to conserve tree species diversity, we also evaluated the diversity of species that can persist as viable metapopulations in a dynamic patchwork of short-lived successional forests, using different assumptions about the average relative size at reproductive maturity. We found a deterministic shift in the diversity and composition of the local plant communities as well as the metacommunity, driven by variation in the rate at which species recruited into and disappeared from the secondary forests across the landscape. Our results indicate that dispersal limitation and the successional niche operate simultaneously and shape successional dynamics of the metacommunity of these early secondary forests. A high diversity of plant species across the metacommunity of early secondary forests shows a potential for restoration of diverse forests through natural succession, when trees and fragments of older forests are maintained in the agricultural matrix and land is abandoned or set aside for a long period of time. On the other hand, during the first 32 years the number of species with mature-sized individuals was a relatively small and strongly biased sub-sample of the total species pool. This implies that ephemeral secondary forests have a limited role in the long-term conservation of tree species diversity in human-modified tropical landscapes.},

abstract = {Wind damage is a significant driver of forest structure, ecology and carbon cycling in both temperate and tropical regions, but most of the literature on wind damage focusses on conifer plantations. Previous studies in broadleaf forests have been limited by a lack of data on tree architecture, a problem that is potentially overcome by terrestrial laser scanning. Here we apply novel approaches to estimate the critical wind speeds at which trees will break in a temperate, deciduous forest plot in Wytham Woods, UK, using a combination of field data and finite element analysis. Ash trees (Fraxinus excelsior) tend to have lower critical wind speeds than sycamores (Acer pseudoplatanus), while English oak (Quercus robur) are the most mechanically robust. This difference in critical wind speed is driven by tree size and architecture, rather than material properties. We observe a trade-off between critical wind speed and growth rate, both within and across species. Our estimates of critical wind speeds from field data are lower in summer than in winter, emphasizing the importance of the spring and autumn transition periods. Of the three species we studied, those with lower critical wind speeds drop their leaves earlier in autumn, suggesting that the timing of leaf shedding may be under selection pressure to minimize risk of tree damage from winter storms. These results are tentative, but also intriguing and intuitive.},

abstract = {Most adaptive traits are controlled by large number of genes that may all together be the targets of selection. Adaptation may thus involve multiple but not necessarily substantial allele frequency changes. This has important consequences for the detection of selected loci and implies that a quantitative genetics framework may be more appropriate than the classical 'selective sweep' paradigm. Preferred methods to detect loci involved in local adaptation are based on the detection of 'outlier' values of the allelic differentiation F ST. A quantitative genetics framework is adopted here to review theoretical expectations for how allelic differentiation at quantitative trait loci (F STQ) relates to (i), neutral genetic differentiation (F ST) and (ii), phenotypic differentiation (Q ST). We identify cases where results of outlier-based methods are likely to be poor and where differentiation at selected loci conveys little information regarding local adaptation. A first case is when neutral differentiation is high, so that local adaptation does not necessitate increased differentiation. A second case is when local adaptation is reached via an increased covariance of allelic effects rather than via allele frequency changes, which is more likely under high gene flow when the number of loci is high and selection is recent. The comparison of theoretical predictions with observed data from the literature suggests that polygenic local adaptation involving only faint allele frequency changes are very likely in some species such as forest trees and for climate-related traits. Recent methodological improvements that may alleviate the weakness of F ST-based detection methods are presented. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to analyse the factors explaining spatial variation in soil respiration over topographic transects in a tropical rain forest of French Guiana. The soil of 30 plots along six transects was characterized. The appearance of the 'dry to the touch' character at a depth of less than 1.2 m was used to discriminate soils exhibiting vertical drainage from soils exhibiting superficial lateral drainage and along with colour and texture, to define five classes from well-drained to strongly hydromorphic soils. Spatial variation in soil respiration was closely related to topographic position and soil type. Increasing soil water content and bulk density and decreasing root biomass and soil carbon content explained most of the decrease in soil respiration from the plateaux (vertically drained hypoferralic acrisol) to the bottomlands (haplic gleysol). These results will help to stratify further field experiments and to identify the underlying determinants of spatial variation in soil respiration to develop mechanistic models of soil respiration.

However, the role that contemporary evolution might play in maintaining and enhancing specific ecosystem services has largely been overlooked. Recent advances at the interface of ecology and evolution have demonstrated how contemporary evolution can shape ecological communities and ecosystem functions. We propose a definition and quantitative criteria to study how rapid evolution affects ecosystem services (here termed contemporary evosystem services) and present plausible scenarios where such services might exist. We advocate for the direct measurement of contemporary evosystem services to improve understanding of how changing environments will alter resource availability and human well-being, and highlight the potential utility of managing rapid evolution for future ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Most common diseases are complex genetic traits, with multiple genetic and environmental components contributing to susceptibility. It has been proposed that common genetic variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), influence susceptibility to common disease. This proposal has begun to be tested in numerous studies of association between genetic variation at these common DNA polymorphisms and variation in disease susceptibility. We have performed an extensive review of such association studies. We find that over 600 positive associations between common gene variants and disease have been reported; these associations, if correct, would have tremendous importance for the prevention, prediction, and treatment of most common diseases. However, most reported associations are not robust: of the 166 putative associations which have been studied three or more times, only 6 have been consistently replicated. Interestingly, of the remaining 160 associations, well over half were observed again one or more times. We discuss the possible reasons for this irreproducibility and suggest guidelines for performing and interpreting genetic association studies. In particular, we emphasize the need for caution in drawing conclusions from a single report of an association between a genetic variant and disease susceptibility.},

abstract = {The strong association observed between fire regimes and variation in plant adaptations to fire suggests a rapid response to fire as an agent of selection. It also suggests that fire-related traits are heritable, a precondition for evolutionary change. One example is serotiny, the accumulation of seeds in unopened fruits or cones until the next fire, an important strategy for plant population persistence in fire-prone ecosystems. Here, we evaluate the potential of this trait to respond to natural selection in its natural setting. For this, we use a SNP marker approach to estimate genetic variance and heritability of serotiny directly in the field for two Mediterranean pine species. Study populations were large and heterogeneous in climatic conditions and fire regime. We first estimated the realized relatedness among trees from genotypes, and then partitioned the pheno-typic variance in serotiny using Bayesian animal models that incorporated environmen-tal predictors. As expected, field heritability was smaller (around 0.10 for both species) than previous estimates under common garden conditions (0.20). An estimate on a sub-set of stands with more homogeneous environmental conditions was not different from that in the complete set of stands, suggesting that our models correctly captured the environmental variation at the spatial scale of the study. Our results highlight the importance of measuring quantitative genetic parameters in natural populations, where environmental heterogeneity is a critical aspect. The heritability of serotiny, although not high, combined with high phenotypic variance within populations, confirms the potential of this fire-related trait for evolutionary change in the wild.},

Whereas resistance is often quantitative, there is limited information on the genes that underpin quantitative variation in disease resistance. We used a population genomic approach to identify genes in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) that are associated with resistance to pitch canker, a disease incited by the necrotrophic pathogen Fusarium circinatum. A set of 498 largely unrelated, clonally propagated genotypes were inoculated with F. circinatum microconidia and lesion length, a measure of disease resistance, data were collected 4, 8, and 12 weeks after inoculation. Best linear unbiased prediction was used to adjust for imbalance in number of observations and to identify highly susceptible and highly resistant genotypes ("tails"). The tails were reinoculated to validate the results of the full population screen. Significant associations were detected in 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (out of 3938 tested). As hypothesized for genes involved in quantitative resistance, the 10 SNPs had small effects and proposed roles in basal resistance, direct defense, and signal transduction. We also discovered associated genes with unknown function, which would have remained undetected in a candidate gene approach constrained by annotation for disease resistance or stress response.},

abstract = {Not a single tree species distribution in the Amazon basin has been reliably mapped, though speculation regarding such distributions has been extensive. We present data from a network of 21 forest plots in Manu National Park, Peru, totaling {\textgreater}36 ha and sited over an area of ∼400 km2, to explore how tree species are distributed across upper Amazonia at a variety of spatial scales. For each of 825 tree species occurring in the plots we asked three questions: (1) Does the species have a large or small geographic range? (2) Is the species restricted to a single forest type, or is it found in several? (3) Is the species locally abundant anywhere or is it scarce everywhere? The answers served to classify a subset of species under Rabinowitz's classification scheme for rare species. Three main conclusions emerged. First, the great majority of tree species at Manu are geographically widespread. Every species identified to date occurs elsewhere in South America, outside the department of Madre de Dios; more than two-thirds of them have been collected 1500 km away in Amazonian Ecuador. Second, 15–26{\%} of species appear to be restricted to a single forest type, when forest types are defined by historical river dynamics (i.e., terra firme forest, mature floodplain forest, swamp forest, and primary successional floodplain forest). The proportion of restricted species declined with increasing sampling effort, making 15{\%} a more reliable figure. Third, while 88{\%} of species occurred at densities of {\textless}1 individual/ha over the entire network of plots, at least half occurred somewhere at densities of {\textgreater}1.5 individuals/ha. Extrapolating these results provides a first guess at how tree species are distributed across the western portion of the Amazon basin. We conclude with the suggestion that most tree species in the region are habitat generalists occurring over large areas of the Amazonian lowlands at low densities but large absolute population sizes.},

abstract = {The evolutionary dynamics of quantitative traits in a species depends on demographic structure (e.g. age- and size-dependent vital rates, migration across subpopulations, mate preferences, and the presence or absence of overlapping generations), which in turn can depend on interspecific interactions with other evolving species. Furthermore, biologists increasingly appreciate that evolutionary change in a single species can substantively affect broader ecological processes, such as community assembly and ecosystem functioning. Models integrating insights from classical population and quantitative genetics, on the one hand, and community ecology theory, on the other, are therefore critical to elucidating the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes. However, few modelling approaches integrate ecological and genetic details into a comprehensive framework. Such models are needed to account for the reciprocal feedback between evolutionary change and ecological dynamics, and develop effective responses to anthropogenic disturbances on natural communities, improve agricultural practices and manage global health risks such as emerging pathogens. Here we introduce an open-source, multi-species forward-time population genetics simulator and framework for rapidly simulating eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our approach permits building models that can account for alternative genetic architectures, non-standard population dynamics and demographic structures, including those driven by interspecific interactions with other evolving species and the spatial dynamics of metacommunities. By integrating these processes into a common framework, we aim to facilitate the development of models that can further elucidate eco-evolutionary dynamics. While multi-species, forward-time population genetic models can be computationally expensive, we show how our framework leverages relatively economical graphics cards installed in modern desktops. We illustrate the versatility and general applicability of our approach for two very different case studies: antagonistic coevolution in space, and the evolution of life-history traits in response to resource dynamics in physiologically structured populations. We find that our analyses can run up to c. 200 times faster on a single commodity graphics card than on a single CPU core, comparable to the performance gains on small-to-medium sized computer clusters. Our approach therefore substantively reduces implementation difficulties to integrating ecological and evolutionary theory.},

A consequence of this is that the meristematic initials of a plant accumulate mutations as it ages2-4. We report here that the mutation rates in the long-lived mangrove are 25 times higher than in the annuals barley and buckwheat. An increase in the frequency of mutant initials is, in effect, an increase in the mutation rate per generation, leading to the prediction that long-lived plants will have higher mutation rates per generation than short-lived plants. Because the mutation rate per generation is the primary determinant of inbreeding depression and the dominant and recessive components of genetic load5-7, plant age and/or life span8 may be a critical and generally unrecognized aspect of the evolutionary equation. {\textcopyright} 1989 Nature Publishing Group.},

There is potential to distinguish between adaptation from standing variation and that from new mutations by differences in the genomic signature of selection.

abstract = {Key message: Across five biogeographic areas, DBH-CA allometry was characterized by inter-site homogeneity and intra-site heterogeneity, whereas the reverse was observed for DBH-H allometry. Abstract: Tree crowns play a central role in stand dynamics. Remotely sensed canopy images have been shown to allow inferring stand structure and biomass which suggests that allometric scaling between stems and crowns may be tight, although insufficiently investigated to date. Here, we report the first broad-scale assessment of stem vs. crown scaling exponents using measurements of bole diameter (DBH), total height (H), and crown area (CA) made on 4148 trees belonging to 538 species in five biogeographic areas across the wet tropics. Allometries were fitted with power functions using ordinary least-squares regressions on log-transformed data. The inter-site variability and intra-site (sub-canopy vs. canopy trees) variability of the allometries were evaluated by comparing the scaling exponents. Our results indicated that, in contrast to both DBH-H and H-CA allometries, DBH-CA allometry shows no significant inter-site variation. This fairly invariant scaling calls for increased effort in documenting crown sizes as part of tree morphology. Stability in DBH-CA allometry, indeed, suggests that some universal constraints are sufficiently pervasive to restrict the exponent variation to a narrow range. In addition, our results point to inverse changes in the scaling exponent of the DBH-CA vs. DBH-H allometries when shifting from sub-canopy to canopy trees, suggesting a change in carbon allocation when a tree reaches direct light. These results pave the way for further advances in our understanding of niche partitioning in tree species, tropical forest dynamics, and to estimate AGB in tropical forests from remotely sensed images.},

abstract = {Current circumstances — that the majority of species distribution records exist as presence-only data (e.g. from museums and herbaria), and that there is an established need for predictions of species distributions — mean that scientists and conservation managers seek to develop robust methods for using these data. Such methods must, in particular, accommodate the difficulties caused by lack of reliable information about sites where species are absent. Here we test two approaches for overcoming these difficulties, analysing a range of data sets using the technique of multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). MARS is closely related to regression techniques such as generalized additive models (GAMs) that are commonly and successfully used in modelling species distributions, but has particular advantages in its analytical speed and the ease of transfer of analysis results to other computational environments such as a Geographic Information System. MARS also has the advantage that it can model multiple responses, meaning that it can combine information from a set of species to determine the dominant environmental drivers of variation in species composition. We use data from 226 species from six regions of the world, and demonstrate the use of MARS for distribution modelling using presence-only data. We test whether (1) the type of data used to represent absence or background and (2) the signal from multiple species affect predictive performance, by evaluating predictions at completely independent sites where genuine presence–absence data were recorded. Models developed with absences inferred from the total set of presence-only sites for a biological group, and using simultaneous analysis of multiple species to inform the choice of predictor variables, performed better than models in which species were analysed singly, or in which pseudo-absences were drawn randomly from the study area.

Correlation between the abundances of stream fish species and longitudinal position in stream networks is well documented and is hypothesized to occur through differential environmental filtering of trophic traits. Still, trophically similar congeners often exhibit complementary distributions along stream size gradients, suggesting that other mechanisms are important. We present niche models to test the hypothesis that four congeneric pairs (Teleostei: Cyprinidae) exhibit complementary distributions along a gradient of stream size in the central Great Plains of Kansas, USA.

abstract = {Abstract Leaf longevity and leaf turnover rate are important plant traits relating to plant growth, leaf photosynthesis and respiration, plant canopy dynamic and many other factors, but dynamic global vegetation models only set inaccurate values for these factors. In this study, we firstly investigated the leaf longevities at major vegetation types based on 418 field measurements from around the world. By replacing the default leaf longevities in the Lund-Potsdam-Jena model (LPJ) with the revised values, we examined the changes in simulated carbon cycle caused by the revised parameters. The results suggested that the compiled observations of leaf longevity were significantly different from the default values in LPJ. Both the vegetation production and respiration of the simulated natural ecosystems showed significant changes based on the revised leaf longevity compared with the predictions developed using default model parameters. Of all of the variables, the aboveground and belowground litter pools showed the largest changes (about 10{\%} globally). Globally, the default parameters induced a significant overestimation of terrestrial carbon sink by 3{\%}, compared with a simulation using the revised parameters. Furthermore, the uncertainties in leaf longevity caused various uncertainties (5–30{\%}) in the simulated carbon fluxes and carbon pools. The offset of biases in intermediate variables might result in rational final model outputs. Overall, more accurate leaf longevities are critical for simulating the vegetation distribution and ecosystem carbon cycle.},

abstract = {A negative consequence of biodiversity loss is reduced rates of ecosystem functions. Phylogenetic-based biodiversity indices have been claimed to provide more accurate predictions of ecosystem functioning than species diversity alone. This approach assumes that the most relevant traits for ecosystem functioning present a phylogenetic signal. Yet, traits-mediating niche partitioning and resource uptake efficiency in animals can be labile. To assess the relative power of a key trait (body size) and phylogeny to predict zooplankton top-down control on phytoplankton, we manipulated trait and phylogenetic distances independently in microcosms while holding species richness constant. We found that body size provided strong predictions of top-down control. In contrast, phylogeny was a poor predictor of grazing rates. Size-related grazing efficiency asymmetry was mechanistically more important than niche differences in mediating ecosystem function in our experimental settings. Our study demonstrates a strong link between a single functional trait (i.e. body size) in zooplankton and trophic interactions, and urges for a cautionary use of phylogenetic information and taxonomic diversity as substitutes for trait information to predict and understand ecosystem functions.},

I investigated the factors contributing to reproductive isolation between Costus pulverulentus and C. scaber (Costaceae), two closely related hummingbird-pollinated understory Neotropical herbs. I studied broad-scale geographic isolation, microhabitat isolation, flowering phenology, overlap in pollinator assemblages, floral constancy by pollinators, mechanical floral isolation, pollen-pistil interactions, seed set in interspecific crosses, and postzygotic isolation (hybrid seed germination, greenhouse survival to flowering, and pollen fertility). Aside from substantial geographic isolation, I found evidence for several factors contributing to reproductive isolation in the sympatric portion of their geographic ranges, but the identity and relative strength of these factors varied depending on the direction of potential gene flow. For C. pulverulentus as the maternal parent, mechanical floral isolation was the most important factor, acting as a complete block to interspecific pollen deposition. For C. scaber as the maternal parent, microhabitat isolation, pollinator assemblage, mechanical floral isolation, and postpollination pollen-pistil incompatibility were important. Overall, prezygotic barriers were found to be strong, resulting in 100{\%} reproductive isolation for C. pulverulentus as the maternal parent and 99.0{\%} reproductive isolation for C. scaber as the maternal parent. Some postzygotic isolation also was identified in the F1 generation, increasing total isolation for C. scaber to 99.4{\%}. The results suggest that ecological factors, including habitat use and plant pollinator interactions, contributed to speciation in this system and evolved before extensive intrinsic postzygotic isolation.},

abstract = {Key message: Forest disturbance affects the within-population distribution of genetic diversity, but not its overall levels, in a tropical pioneer tree species. In particular, clumps of related saplings with impoverished diversity are found in canopy gaps but not under forest cover. Context: Forest disturbances can have long-term consequences on the genetic structure of tree populations, because they can alter the demographic properties of the regeneration process and favour some subpopulations/genotypes, both by stochastic processes and by selection. Intermediate disturbances tend to favour species diversity, at least in highly diverse communities, but their effect on intra-specific diversity is unknown. Aims: In this study, we have looked at the genetic consequences of forest disturbance in a stand of the long-lived Neotropical pioneer species, Jacaranda copaia. Methods: The study site was experimentally logged in 1984, and the canopy gaps generated by the logging were mapped. Seedlings of J. copaia colonised the gaps, as expected, at a higher density than in the surrounding forest. In 2006, we exhaustively sampled all saplings and adult trees available in a 25-ha area. The samples were genotyped at nine microsatellite loci, and the distribution of genetic diversity was inspected by analyses of spatial autocorrelation, automated Bayesian assignment and comparisons of diversity between cohorts by bootstrap (RaBoT). Results: Spatial autocorrelation was found to extend farther in post-disturbance saplings than in the undisturbed population (100 m and beyond versus less than 50 m), and divergent clumps (F{\textless}inf{\textgreater}ST{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} = 0.05) of related genotypes were found; genetic diversity was found to be impoverished in each clump relative to the global population at about half of the loci. Conclusion: Overall, our results suggest that forest disturbance has changed the patterns of distribution of genetic diversity, with potential consequences on long-term population viability.},

abstract = {Although forest succession has traditionally been approached as a deterministic process, successional trajectories of vegetation change vary widely, even among nearby stands with similar environmental conditions and disturbance histories. Here, we provide the first attempt, to our knowledge, to quantify predictability and uncertainty during succession based on the most extensive long-term datasets ever assembled for Neotropical forests. We develop a novel approach that integrates deterministic and stochastic components into different candidate models describing the dynamical interactions among three widely used and interrelated forest attributes--stem density, basal area, and species density. Within each of the seven study sites, successional trajectories were highly idiosyncratic, even when controlling for prior land use, environment, and initial conditions in these attributes. Plot factors were far more important than stand age in explaining successional trajectories. For each site, the best-fit model was able to capture the complete set of time series in certain attributes only when both the deterministic and stochastic components were set to similar magnitudes. Surprisingly, predictability of stem density, basal area, and species density did not show consistent trends across attributes, study sites, or land use history, and was independent of plot size and time series length. The model developed here represents the best approach, to date, for characterizing autogenic successional dynamics and demonstrates the low predictability of successional trajectories. These high levels of uncertainty suggest that the impacts of allogenic factors on rates of change during tropical forest succession are far more pervasive than previously thought, challenging the way ecologists view and investigate forest regeneration.},

abstract = {The effects of drought on several major morphological and anatomical features of leaves were investigated in an attempt to explain the origin of the difference in drought resistance between two olive (Olea europaea L.) cultivars, ('Chemlali' and 'Meski') previously demonstrated to be drought-resistant and drought-sensitive, respectively. Under water deficit conditions, 'Chemlali' maintained higher rates of photosynthetic assimilation and lower rates of transpiration compared to 'Meski'. In the present study, we found cultivar-dependent differences in leaf morphoanatomical adaptations to drought stress. When subjected to water stress, the leaves of 'Chemlali' increased the thickness of their upper palisade and spongy parenchyma by 17{\%} and 22{\%}, respectively, compared with only 9{\%} and 13{\%} in the case of 'Meski'. A thicker palisade parenchyma could contain larger numbers of CO2-fixation sites, while a thicker spongy parenchyma could result in easier diffusion of CO2 to these sites. Furthermore, stomatal density (SD) in 'Chemlali' leaves increased by 25{\%} (vs. 7{\%} for 'Meski' leaves) during drought treatment, which could also enhance the external supply of CO2. Other morpho-structural traits implicated in the control of water loss were enhanced more in 'Chemlali' than in 'Meski' leaves. Under conditions of lower water availability, leaf size decreased by 24{\%} in 'Chemlali' (vs. 15{\%} in 'Meski'), trichome density (TD) increased by 25{\%} (while remaining unchanged in 'Meski'), and the thickness of the upper and lower epidermis increased by 32{\%} and 25{\%}, respectively (while remaining unchanged in 'Meski'). The above morpho-anatomical adaptations should improve the water-use efficiency of the tree. These differential changes in leaf morphology and anatomy can explain, at least in part, the difference in drought resistance between the two cultivars. In particular, the upper palisade parenchyma, the spongy parenchyma, SD, and TD could be considered key structural features of leaves that govern the ability of a tree to withstand water stress. They could therefore be used as criteria to select olive cultivars that are more resistant to drought.},

abstract = {Physiognomy, structure and floristic composition of one hectare of lowland tropical rain forest was studied in detail at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. Physiognomically, the Los Tuxtlas forest should be classified as ‘lowland tropical high evergreen rain forest'. The forest showed a closed canopy at 30–35 m. Of all woody, non-climbing species with a DBH=1.0 cm 89.4{\%} (94.5{\%} of all individuals) were evergreen, 25.4{\%} (59.5{\%} of the individuals) had compound leaves, and over 80{\%} of species (and individuals) had leaves in the notophyll and mesophyll size classes. The forest structure was characterized by a low density (2976 individuals with a DBH=1.0 cm, 346 individuals with a DBH=10.0 cm, per ha, excluding vines) with an average basal area (38.1 m2, DBH=1.0 cm, 34.9 m2, DBH=10.0 cm, per ha, excluding vines). This was attributed to the relative maturity of the forest on the study plot. The study plot contained 234 species (11 208 individuals with a height =0.5 m), of which 55.1{\%} (34.8{\%} of individuals) were trees, 9.4{\%} (6.8{\%}) shrubs, 3.4{\%} (44.3{\%}) palms, 20.1{\%} (5.2{\%}) vines, 6.8{\%} (8.7{\%}) herbs and 5.1{\%} (0.3{\%}) of unknown lifeform. Furthermore, 58 species of epiphytes and hemi-epiphytes were found. Diversity of trees, shrubs and palms with a DBH=1.0 cm was calculated as Shannon-Wiener index (4.65), Equitability index (0.65), and Simpson index (0.10). The dominance-diversity curve showed a lognormal form, characteristic for tropical rain forest. The community structure was characterized by a relative dominance of Astrocaryum mexicanum in the understorey, Pseudolmedia oxyphyllaria in the middle storeys, and Nectandra ambigens in the canopy. Species population structures of 31 species showed three characteristic patterns, differentiated by recruitment: continuously high, discontinuously high, and continuously low recruitment. Height/diameter and crown cover/diameter diagrams suggested a very gradual shift from height growth to crown growth during tree development. Forest turnover was calculated as 138 years. Compared to other tropical rain forests the Los Tuxtlas forest had 1. similar leaf physiognomical characteristics, 2. a lower diversity, 3. a lower density, 4. an average basal area, and 5. a slow canopy turnover.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association mapping (GWAS) is a method to estimate the contribution of segregating genetic loci to trait variation. A major challenge for applying GWAS to non-model species has been generating dense genome-wide markers that satisfy the key requirement that marker data is error-free. Here we present an approach to map loci within natural populations using inexpensive shallow genome sequencing. This 'SNP skimming' approach involves two steps: an initial genome-wide scan to identify putative targets followed by deep sequencing for confirmation of targeted loci. We apply our method to a test dataset of floral dimension variation in the plant Penstemon virgatus, a member of a genus that has experienced dynamic floral adaptation that reflects repeated transitions in primary pollinator. The ability to detect SNPs that generate phenotypic variation depends on population genetic factors such as population allele frequency, effect size, and epistasis as well as sampling effects contingent on missing data and genotype uncertainty. However, both simulations and the Penstemon data suggest that the most significant tests from the initial SNP skim are likely to be true positives - loci with subtle but significant quantitative effects on phenotype. We discuss the promise and limitations of this method and consider optimal experimental design for a given sequencing effort. Simulations demonstrate that sampling a larger number of individual at the expense of average read depth per individual maximizes the power to detect loci. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {In mammals, cadmium is widely considered as a non-genotoxic carcinogen acting through a methylation-dependent epigenetic mechanism. Here, the effects of Cd treatment on the DNA methylation patten are examined together with its effect on chromatin reconfiguration in Posidonia oceanica. DNA methylation level and pattern were analysed in actively growing organs, under short-(6 h) and long-(2 d or 4 d) term and low (10 $\mu$M) and high (50 $\mu$M) doses of Cd, through a Methylation-Sensitive Amplification Polymorphism technique and an immunocytological approach, respectively. The expression of one member of the CHROMOMETHYLASE (CMT) family, a DNA methyltransferase, was also assessed by qRT-PCR. Nuclear chromatin ultrastructure was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Cd treatment induced a DNA hypermethylation, as well as an up-regulation of CMT, indicating that de novo methylation did indeed occur. Moreover, a high dose of Cd led to a progressive heterochromatinization of interphase nuclei and apoptotic figures were also observed after long-term treatment. The data demonstrate that Cd perturbs the DNA methylation status through the involvement of a specific methyltransferase. Such changes are linked to nuclear chromatin reconfiguration likely to establish a new balance of expressed/repressed chromatin. Overall, the data show an epigenetic basis to the mechanism underlying Cd toxicity in plants. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author.},

abstract = {Seasonal variations in environmental conditions influence the functioning of the whole ecosystem of tropical rain forests, but as yet little is known about how such variations directly influence the leaf gas exchange and transpiration of individual canopy tree species. We examined the influence of seasonal variations in relative extractable water in the upper soil layers on predawn leaf water potential, saturated net photosynthesis, leaf dark respiration, stomatal conductance, and tree transpiration of 13 tropical rain forest canopy trees (eight species) over 2 yr in French Guiana. The canopies were accessed by climbing ropes attached to the trees and to a tower. Our results indicate that a small proportion of the studied trees were unaffected by soil water depletion during seasonal dry periods, probably thanks to efficient deep root systems. The trees showing decreased tree water status (i.e., predawn leaf water potential) displayed a wide range of leaf gas exchange responses. Some trees strongly regulated photosynthesis and transpiration when relative extractable water decreased drastically. In contrast, other trees showed little variation, thus indicating good adaptation to soil drought conditions. These results have important applications to modeling approaches: indeed, precise evaluation and grouping of these response patterns are required before any tree-based functional models can efficiently describe the response of tropical rain forest ecosystems to future changes in environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2012 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

We examined the co-occurrence patterns of over 1100 tree species in a 25-hectare Amazonian forest plot in relation to field-measured functional traits. Using a null model approach, we show that co-occurring trees are often less ecologically similar than a niche-free (neutral) model predicts. Furthermore, we find evidence for processes that simultaneously drive convergence and divergence in key aspects of plant strategy, suggesting that at least two distinct niche-based processes are occurring. Our results show that strategy differentiation among species contributes to the maintenance of diversity in one of the most diverse tropical forests in the world.},

Forging strong links between traits and performance is essential for understanding and predicting community assembly and dynamics. Functional trait analyses of trees that have correlated single- Trait values with measures of performance such as growth and mortality have generally found weak relationships. A reason for these weak relationships is the failure to use individual-level trait data while simultaneously putting that data into the context of the abiotic setting, neighborhood composition, and the remaining axes constituting the overall phenotype. Here, utilizing detailed growth and trait data for 59 species of trees in a subtropical forest, we demonstrate that the individual-level functional trait values are strongly related to individual growth rates, and that the strength of these relationships critically depends on the context of that individual. We argue that our understanding of trait-performance relationships can be greatly improved with individual-level data so long as that data is put into the proper context.},

abstract = {1. Disturbances are widespread and may affect community assembly, species composition, (func- tional) diversity and hence ecosystem processes. It remains still unclear to what extent disturbance- mediated species changes scale-up to changes in community functional properties, especially for species-rich tropical forests. 2. A large-scale field experiment was performed in which the dynamics of 15 000 stems {\textgreater}10 cm in diameter was monitored for 8 years in 44 one-ha forest plots. Twelve functional effect and response traits were measured for the most dominant tree species. The effects of different intensities of distur- bance caused by logging and silvicultural treatments on the species and functional diversity of a Bolivian tropical forest community were evaluated, along with how these changes were driven by underlying demographic processes. 3. Disturbance treatments did not affect species diversity or functional diversity indices based on multiple traits related to primary productivity and decomposition rate. This result suggests that spe- cies richness is conserved, and trait variation is maintained, which can buffer the community against environmental change. 4. In contrast, disturbance intensity affected the average plant trait values in the community (the community-weighted mean) for seven of 12 traits evaluated. At high disturbance intensity, the com- munity had a lower wood density of stem and branches, lower leaf toughness and dry matter con- tent, but higher specific leaf area and leaf N- and P concentration, with the value of these traits changing on average 6{\%} over the 8-year period. The functional spectrum of the community chan- ged, therefore, from ‘slow', conservative, shade-tolerant species towards ‘fast', acquisitive, light- demanding species. These functional changes in mean trait values may enhance primary productivity and decomposition rate in the short term. 5. Temporal changes in community functional properties were mainly driven by recruitment, and lit- tle by mortality or survival. 6. Synthesis. Moderate levels of (logging) disturbance neither affected species diversity nor func- tional diversity per se in the 8-year period after logging. Disturbance did, however, change the func- tional community composition towards ‘fast' species with more acquisitive traits, thus potentially fuelling primary productivity and nutrient and carbon cycling. In conclusion, tropical forest manage- ment may contribute to conserving functional biodiversity of trees while providing forest resources.},

@article{Anacker2014,
abstract = {A goal of evolutionary biology is to understand the roles of geography and ecology in speciation. The recent shared ancestry of sister species can leave a major imprint on their geographical and ecological attributes, possibly revealing processes involved in speciation. We examined how ecological similarity, range overlap and range asymmetry are related to time since divergence of 71 sister species pairs in the California Floristic Province (CFP). We found that plants exhibit strikingly different age-range correlation patterns from those found for animals; the latter broadly support allopatric speciation as the primary mode of speciation. By contrast, plant sisters in the CFP were sympatric in 80{\%} of cases and range sizes of sisters differed by a mean of 10-fold. Range overlap and range asymmetrywere greatest in younger sisters. These results suggest that speciation mechanisms broadly grouped under 'budding' speciation, in which a larger ranged progenitor gives rise to a smaller ranged derivative species, are probably common. The ecological and reproductive similarity of sisters was significantly greater than that of sister-non-sister congeners for every trait assessed. However, shifts in at least one trait were present in 93{\%} of the sister pairs; habitat and soil shifts were especially common. Ecological divergence did not increase with range overlap contrary to expectations under character displacement in sympatry. Our results suggest that vicariant speciation is more ubiquitous in animals than plants, perhaps owing to the sensitivity of plants to fine-scale environmental heterogeneity. Despite high levels of range overlap, ecological shifts in the process of budding speciation may result in lowrates of fine-scale spatial co-occurrence. These results have implications for ecological studies of trait evolution and community assembly; despite high levels of sympatry, sister taxa and potentially other close relatives, may be missing from local communities. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract = {Key message We review causes of synergies in mixed- species stands, develop guiding hypotheses for revealing their mechanisms and present a rainfall exclusion experiment along with a transect (KROOF) for ex- ploringdrought effects. Abstract While monocultures have dominated forest research and practice in the past, in face of growing resource scarcity and climate change, mixed-species stands are on the advance. Long-term observations show that mixed-species stands frequently over-yield monocultures, and they further suggest that the over-yielding is often higher on poor than on fertile sites and in low-growth than in high-growth years. However, the underlying causes have not yet been clarified. We start with a review of, among others, hydraulic redistribution, complementary eco-phys- iological traits, and ectomycorrhizal networks as possible causes behind the observed productivity gains in mixed- species stands. Then, we develop guiding hypotheses for further exploration of synergies in mixed-species stands. Finally, we introduce into the concept and model approach of the rainfall exclusion experiment for examining the role of water supply in mixed versus pure forest stands of spruce and beech. At the Kranzberg site, six plots are equipped with water retention roofs, which only close during rain events. The remaining six plots serve as non- roofed control. Together with the rainfall exclusion experiment, an ecological gradient with five sites extending through SE-Germany forms the ‘‘Kranzberg Roof Experi- ment'' (in short KROOF). Kranzberg Forest is a part of this gradient from moist to dry conditions, with each site pro- viding mixed and pure associations each of spruce and beech. The ecophysiological approach will be comple- mented by tree ring analysis and modelling of productivity of the tree associations under intense drought.},

@article{Thorpe2010,
abstract = {a b s t r a c t Across forest ecosystems worldwide, alternative silvicultural practices such as partial or " structural reten-tion " harvesting are gaining increasing use as means to balance economic and ecological management goals. Recent studies have documented highly elevated rates of residual-tree mortality and growth, both of which are likely to influence post-harvest stand development. Explicit consideration of residual-tree responses to partial harvest is therefore required to make accurate growth and yield predictions. In this paper we incorporate empirically based, spatially explicit tree growth and mortality predictors into a for-est simulation model in order to quantify stand dynamics following a range of simulated partial harvests. We consider lowland black spruce boreal forests and use a common strip-cutting technique, Harvest with Advance Regeneration Protection, as a reference against which to compare alternative scenarios. Predicted stand development proceeded most rapidly in scenarios with reduced skidding impacts and rel-atively high levels of retention, since these treatments were associated with lower residual-tree mortality rates and larger growing stocks respectively. Stand development was also influenced on a proportional basis by residual-tree growth rates, which increased with declining neighbourhood competition. Across a range of harvest scenarios with equivalent retention levels (20{\%}), differences in residual-tree responses among treatments led to a 35-year range in projected basal area return intervals (70–105 years). Our results demonstrate that short-term responses of residual trees affect stand development rates over long ({\textgreater}100-year) time scales, and show that post-harvest stand recovery rates are influenced not only by the retention level but also by the specific parameters of partial harvest prescriptions, including the layout of skid trails and the spatial arrangement of residual trees. Results from this study provide essential infor-mation for evaluating partial harvests in the black spruce boreal forest and supply modelling tools for assessing alternative silvicultural treatments in other forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {I review the mathematical and biological aspects of Hubbell's (2001) neutral theory of species abundance for ecological communities, and clarify its historical connections with closely related approaches in population genetics. A selective overview of the empirical evidence for and against this theory is provided, with a special emphasis on tropical plant communities. The neutral theory predicts many of the basic patterns of biodiversity, confirming its heuristic power. The strict assumption of equivalence that defines neutrality, equivalence among individuals, finds little empirical support in general. However, a weaker assumption holds for stable communities, the equivalence of average fitness among species. One reason for the surprising success of the neutral theory is that all the theories of species coexistence satisfying the fitness equivalence assumption, including many theories of niche differentiation, generate exactly the same patterns as the neutral theory. Hubbell's neutral theory represents an important synthesis and a much needed demonstration of the pivotal role of intraspecific variability in ecology. Further improvements should lead to an explicit linking to niche-based processes. This research programme will depend crucially on forthcoming theoretical and empirical achievements.},

abstract = {Analyses of tree diversity and community composition in tropical rain forests are usually based either on general herbarium data or on a restricted number of botanical plots. Despite their high taxonomic accuracy, both types of data are difficult to extrapolate to landscape scales. Meanwhile, forestry surveys provide quantitative occurrence data on large areas, and are thus increasingly used for landscape-scale analyses of tree diversity. However, the reliability of these approaches has been challenged because of the ambiguity of the common (vernacular) names used by foresters and the complexity of tree taxonomy in those hyper-diverse communities.We developed and tested a novel approach to evaluate taxonomic reliability of forestry surveys and to propagate the resulting uncertainty in the estimates of several diversity indicators (alpha and beta entropy, Fisher-alpha and S{\o}rensen similarity). Our approach is based on Monte-Carlo processes that simulate communities by taking into account the expected accuracy and reliability of common names. We tested this method in French Guiana, on 9 one-hectare plots (4279 trees - DBH. ≥. 10. cm) for which both common names and standardized taxonomic determinations were available. We then applied our method of community simulation on large forestry inventories (560. ha) at the landscape scale and compared the diversity indices obtained for 10 sites with those computed from precise botanical determination situated at the same localities.We found that taxonomic reliability of forestry inventories varied from 22{\%} (species level) to 83{\%} (family level) in this Amazonian region. Indices computed directly with raw forestry data resulted in incorrect values, except for Gini-Simpson beta-diversity. On the contrary, our correction method provides more accurate diversity estimates, highly correlated with botanical measurements, for almost all diversity indices at both regional and local scales. We obtained a robust ranking of sites consistent with those shown by botanical inventories.These results show that (i) forestry inventories represent a significant part of taxonomic information, (ii) the relative diversity of regional sites can be successfully ranked using forestry inventory data using our method and (iii) forestry inventories can valuably contribute to the detection of large-scale diversity patterns when biases are well-controlled and corrected.The tools we developed as R-functions are available in supplementary material and can be adapted with local parameters to be used for forest management and conservation issues in other regional contexts. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

However, existing methods for exact computation of standard test statistics are computationally impractical for even moderate-sized genome-wide association studies. To address this issue, several approximate methods have been proposed. Here, we present an efficient exact method, which we refer to as genome-wide efficient mixed-model association (GEMMA), that makes approximations unnecessary in many contexts. This method is approximately n times faster than the widely used exact method known as efficient mixed-model association (EMMA), where n is the sample size, making exact genome-wide association analysis computationally practical for large numbers of individuals. {\textcopyright} 2012 Nature America, Inc.

Here, we use data from a large-scale biodiversity experiment with 24 subtropical tree species to show that neighbourhood tree species richness generally promotes individual tree productivity. We found that the underlying mechanisms depend on a focal tree's functional traits: For species with a conservative resource-use strategy diversity effects were brought about by facilitation, and for species with acquisitive traits by competitive reduction. Moreover, positive diversity effects were strongest under low competition intensity (quantified as the total basal area of neighbours) for acquisitive species, and under high competition intensity for conservative species. Our findings demonstrate that net biodiversity effects in tree communities can vary over small spatial scales, emphasising the need to consider variation in local neighbourhood interactions to better under- stand effects at the community level.},

abstract = {Moisture availability is the main limiting factor of plant growth and biomass production in arid and semi-arid grasslands. The question whether plant responses to changing precipitation are species-specific, or change over entire plant communities is still controversial. Our study focussed on intraspecific changes in the plant traits canopy height, plant width, specific leaf area, chlorophyll fluorescence, performance index, and individual biomass of three congeneric species pairs with changing precipitation in Mongolian rangelands, covering a gradient from the desert to the forest steppes. Using this trait data set, we focussed on three questions: (i) Is the replacement of congeneric species along an environmental gradient also reflected in their trait values? (ii) Can intraspecific trait variation patterns be derived from patterns in species abundances, i.e., are trait values optimal where species are most abundant? (iii) Is the within-population trait variability lowest in populations growing under very dry conditions, i.e., under highest environmental stress, caused by stronger filtering? We tested the responses of the six traits to changing precipitation according to species' identity and abundance. We found unimodal relationships between most of the species' traits and precipitation, and strong associations between species abundances and trait values, but not for all investigated species. Trait variability did not significantly differ between populations from different positions along the precipitation gradient. Our results highlight that species show multiple or even opposite trait responses along the precipitation gradient. It thus remains challenging to predict how plant distributions will shift under changing environmental conditions based on their trait composition.},

The scientific community increasingly recognizes the need for dynamic models integrating sufficient complexity both to improve our understanding of species' responses to environmental changes and to inform effective management strategies. Using three illustrative examples, we introduce a novel modelling platform, RangeShifter, which integrates complex population dynamics and dispersal behaviour, includes plastic and evolutionary processes and simulates scenarios on spatially explicit landscapes. The software provides functionality for a wide variety of modelling applications ranging from applied questions, where it can be parameterized for real landscapes and species to compare alternative potential management interventions, to purely theoretical studies of species' eco-evolutionary dynamics and responses to different environmental pressures.

abstract = {The spatial distribution of two rain forest tree species, Carapa procera (Meliaceae) and Vouacapoua americana (Caesalpiniaceae) was analysed within and between plots of different sizes (6.25 and 25 ha) at Paracou, French Guiana. The L(d) function was used to characterize spatial patterns, and the L ij (d) intertype to study independancy between young and adult trees. Although both species are known to be dispersed by caviomorph rodents within short distances ( c. 10–20 m and up to 50 m) of parent tree crowns, the analysis of tree positions led to different spatial patterns between species depending on soil drainage characteristics. Overall, while V. americana showed a strongly aggregated spatial distribution, C. procera had a weaker propensity to depart from complete spatial randomness (CSR). A complex distribution, sometimes clustered in areas with hydromorphic soils (swamps and around streams) and sometimes very near CSR outside these areas characterized the C. procera population. When C. procera tree aggregation occurred, there was a slight attraction between juveniles and adults. The aggregation of V. americana trees was evidenced at different levels depending on the scale of investigation. Within small plots (6.25 ha), a first level of aggregation with short distance radii of c. 10–25 m giving small clusters, and a second level which is composed of small clusters aggregated at c. 40–50 m distance radius, were observed. A third level of aggregation was suggested by analysing the tree population at the larger scale (25 ha) whose boundaries outside the plot were not delimited. Aggregation of V. americana trees at all levels was enhanced by a strong attraction between juveniles and adults. These results were discussed in light of seed and seedling ecology, especially with regard to seedling and sapling gap-dependence and soil drainage, which likely affected the recruitment of juvenile trees, and henceforth final tree spatial pattern.},

To face these novel threats, conservation biologists are in need of a thorough understanding and identification of adaptive variation in key fitness traits. We here provide an elaborate synthesis of pre-existing and novel analyses of an association mapping, genecological and landscape genomic study integrating genotypic, environmental and phenotypic data to gain insights into the genetic basis of cold-hardiness adaptation in coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii). Data were collected across part of the natural range for a total of 643 individuals. A landscape genomic approach revealed 28 putative non-neutral genes, although a variance partitioning analysis indicated only moderate power of this gene set in explaining cold-hardiness-related phenotypic variation, and suggests many important genes await discovery. Integrating these results within the entire phenotype-genotype-environment spectrum allowed us to delineate the six most promising candidate genes under selection. By combining genomic, phenotypic and environmental data, this study attempts to gain insights in the genetic basis of key adaptations, which may ultimately aid forestry managers to establish resilient ecosystems in face of future climate change.},

abstract = {When a selectively favourable gene substitution occurs in a population, changes in gene frequencies will occur at closely linked loci. In the case of a neutral polymorphism, average heterozygosity will be reduced to an extent which varies with distance from the substituted locus. The aggregate effect of substitution on neutral polymorphism is estimated; in populations of total size 106 or more (and perhaps of 104 or more), this effect will be more important than that of random fixation. This may explain why the extent of polymorphism in natural populations does not vary as much as one would expect from a consideration of the equilibrium between mutation and random fixation in populations of different sizes. For a selectively maintained polymorphism at a linked locus, this process will only be important in the long run if it leads to complete fixation. If the selective coefficients at the linked locus are small compared to those at the substituted locus, it is shown that the probability of complete fixation at the linked locus is approximately exp (− Nc), where c is the recombinant fraction and N the population size. It follows that in a large population a selective substitution can occur in a cistron without eliminating a selectively maintained polymorphism in the same cistron. {\textcopyright} 1974, Cambridge University Press.

abstract = {Rana temporaria occur across a large geographic and environmental gradient in Scandinavia. Several studies involving common garden experiments have established adaptive divergence across the gradient. The main objective of this study was to determine the extent of neutral and adaptive genetic divergence across the latitudinal gradient. Here we sequence genome-wide markers for 15 populations from six regions sampled from southern Sweden to Finland. Using a multivariate approach we find that 68{\%} of the genomic variation is associated with climate or geographically structured climate. Using outlier scans and environmental association analyses we identify a set of potentially adaptive loci and examine their change in allele frequency associated with different climatic variables. Using a gradient forest analysis we identify points along three of the climate variables where allele frequencies change more rapidly than expected if it were a linear association. We identify a large threshold effect associated with BIO5 (mean temperature during the warmest month) which is seen as a rapid change in southern Sweden. By comparing the change in neutral and adaptive allele frequencies across the whole gradient, we identify southern Sweden as a region with the largest divergence between the datasets. This suggests small changes in the climate may result in a mismatch between the adaptive genotypes and the environment in these populations. Overall this study shows that genomic analyses can provide a powerful complement to common garden experiments to improve our understanding of adaptive divergence across heterogeneous landscapes.},

abstract = {Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is ∼10-20× faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Author(s).},

Lecythidaceae species can be difficult to identify without molecular data, however, and phylogenetic relationships within and among the most diverse genera are poorly resolved. Methods: To develop informative genetic markers for Lecythidaceae, we used genome skimming to de novo assemble the full plastome of the Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa) and 23 other Lecythidaceae species. Indices of nucleotide diversity and phylogenetic signal were used to identify regions suitable for genetic marker development. Results: The B. excelsa plastome contained 160,472 bp and was arranged in a quadripartite structure. Using the 24 plastome alignments, we developed primers for 10 coding and non-coding DNA regions containing exceptional nucleotide diversity and phylogenetic signal. We also developed 19 chloroplast simple sequence repeats for population-level studies. Discussion: The coding region ycf1 and the spacer rpl16-rps3 outperformed plastid DNA markers previously used for barcoding and phylogenetics. Used in a phylogenetic analysis, the matrix of 24 plastomes showed with 100{\%} bootstrap support that Lecythis and Eschweilera are polyphyletic. The plastomes and primers presented in this study will facilitate a broad array of ecological and evolutionary studies in Lecythidaceae.},

Unfortunately, the genes and sequence variants accounting for this variation remain largely unknown due to a variety of biological and technical challenges. Drosophila melanogaster contains high levels of sequence variation and low linkage disequilibrium, allowing us to dissect the effects of many causative variants within a single locus. Here, we take advantage of these features to identify and characterize the sequence polymorphisms that comprise major effect QTL alleles segregating at the bric-a-brac locus. We show that natural bric-a-brac alleles with large effects on cuticular pigmentation reflect a cumulative impact of polymorphisms that affect three functional regions: a promoter, a tissue-specific enhancer, and a Polycomb response element. Analysis of allele-specific expression at the bric-a-brac locus confirms that these polymorphisms modulate transcription at the cis-regulatory level. Our results establish that a single QTL can act through a confluence of multiple molecular mechanisms and that sequence variation in regions flanking experimentally validated functional elements can have significant quantitative effects on transcriptional activity and phenotype. These findings have important design and conceptual implications for basic and medical genomics.},

abstract = {Variation within and between four populations of the highly plastic and ephemeral plant Senecio vulgaris L. has been evaluated for several quantitative characters in three environments and at four stages of development. The populations were from soils of high and low nutrient levels and in habitats of different degrees of exposure. There are significant differences between the means and phenotypic variances of populations for most characters but the degree of difference tends to change both in level and direction between environments and throughout development. However, there are some consistent differences and these seem closely related to the differences between habitats. Of special interest was the variation within populations where it emerged that samples of the populations from sites that were highly heterogeneous for exposure showed much more heritable variation for height and several other characters which might influence the expression of stature than samples from apparently homogeneous sites. It is suggested that though S. vulgaris is capable of showing a wide measure of phenotypic plasticity which could be of adaptive significance in the field, many differences between and within populations may in part be attributed to gene differences that are likely to have resulted from the action of natural selection.

abstract = {Modelling strategies for predicting the potential impacts of climate change on the natural distribution of species have often focused on the characterization of a species' bioclimate envelope. A number of recent critiques have questioned the validity of this approach by pointing to the many factors other than climate that play an important part in determining species distributions and the dynamics of distribution changes. Such factors include biotic interactions, evolutionary change and dispersal ability. This paper reviews and evaluates criticisms of bioclimate envelope models and discusses the implications of these criticisms for the different modelling strategies employed. It is proposed that, although the complexity of the natural system presents fundamental limits to predictive modelling, the bioclimate envelope approach can provide a useful first approximation as to the potentially dramatic impact of climate change on biodiversity. However, it is stressed that the spatial scale at which these models are applied is of fundamental importance, and that model results should not be interpreted without due consideration of the limitations involved. A hierarchical modelling framework is proposed through which some of these limitations can be addressed within a broader, scale-dependent context.},

abstract = {General models of plant vascular architecture, based on scaling of pipe diameters to remove the length dependence of hydraulic resistance within the xylem, have attracted strong interest. However, these models have neglected to consider the leaf, an important hydraulic component; they assume all leaves to have similar hydraulic properties, including similar pipe diameters in the petiole. We examine the scaling of the leaf xylem in 10 temperate oak species, an important hydraulic component. The mean hydraulic diameter of petiole xylem vessels varied by 30{\%} among the 10 oak species. Conduit diameters narrowed from the petiole to the midrib to the secondary veins, consistent with resistance minimization, but the power function scaling exponent differed from that predicted for stems. Leaf size was an organizing trait within and across species. These findings indicate that leaf vasculature needs to be included in whole-plant scaling models, for these to accurately reflect and predict whole-plant transport and its implications for performance and ecology.},

Neotropical trees - whose large and undisturbed populations often span a variety of environmental conditions and local habitats - are particularly good models to study this process. Here, we carried out a genome scan for selection through whole-genome sequencing of pools of populations, sampled according to a nested sampling design, to evaluate microgeographic adaptation in the hyperdominant Amazonian tree Eperua falcata Aubl. (Fabaceae). A high-coverage genomic resource of {\~{}}250 Mb was assembled de novo and annotated, leading to 32,789 predicted genes. 97,062 bi-allelic SNPs were detected over 25,803 contigs, and a custom Bayesian model was implemented to uncover candidate genomic targets of divergent selection. A set of 290 divergence outlier SNPs was detected at the regional scale (between study sites), while 185 SNPs located in the vicinity of 106 protein-coding genes were detected as replicated outliers between microhabitats within regions. These genes potentially underlie ecologically important phenotypes and indicate that adaptation to microgeographic habitat patchiness would affect genomic regions involved in a variety of physiological processes, among which plant response to stress (for e.g., oxidative stress, hypoxia and metal toxicity) and biotic interactions. Identification of genomic targets of microgeographic adaptation in the Neotropics is consistent with the hypothesis that local adaptation is a key driver of ecological diversification, operating across multiple spatial scales, from large- (i.e. regional) to microgeographic- (i.e. landscape) scales.},

However, existing methods typically miss low-allelic-fraction mutations that occur in only a subset of the sequenced cells owing to either tumor heterogeneity or contamination by normal cells. Here we present MuTect, a method that applies a Bayesian classifier to detect somatic mutations with very low allele fractions, requiring only a few supporting reads, followed by carefully tuned filters that ensure high specificity. We also describe benchmarking approaches that use real, rather than simulated, sequencing data to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity as a function of sequencing depth, base quality and allelic fraction. Compared with other methods, MuTect has higher sensitivity with similar specificity, especially for mutations with allelic fractions as low as 0.1 and below, making MuTect particularly useful for studying cancer subclones and their evolution in standard exome and genome sequencing data.

Climate change is expected to intensify regional-scale droughts, focusing attention on the physiological basis of drought-induced tree mortality. Recent work has shown that catastrophic failure of the plant hydraulic system is a principal mechanism involved in extensive crown death and tree mortality during drought, but the multi-dimensional response of trees to desiccation is complex. Here we focus on the current understanding of tree hydraulic performance under drought, the identification of physiological thresholds that precipitate mortality and the mechanisms of recovery after drought. Building on this, we discuss the potential application of hydraulic thresholds to process-based models that predict mortality.},

abstract = {* 1Analyzing the phylogenetic structure of natural communities may illuminate the processes governing the assembly and coexistence of species. For instance, an association between species co-occurrence in local communities and their phylogenetic proximity may reveal the action of habitat filtering, niche conservatism and/or competitive exclusion.
* 2Different methods were recently proposed to test such community-wide phylogenetic patterns, based on the phylogenetic clustering or overdispersion of the species in a local community. This provides a much needed framework for addressing long standing questions in community ecology as well as the recent debate on community neutrality. The testing procedures are based on (i) a metric measuring the association between phylogenetic distance and species co-occurrence, and (ii) a data set randomization algorithm providing the distribution of the metric under a given ‘null model'. However, the statistical properties of these approaches are not well-established and their reliability must be tested against simulated data sets.
* 3This paper reviews metrics and null models used in previous studies. A ‘locally neutral' subdivided community model is simulated to produce data sets devoid of phylogenetic structure in the spatial distribution of species. Using these data sets, the consistency of Type I error rates of tests based on 10 metrics combined with nine null models is examined.
* 4This study shows that most tests can become liberal (i.e. tests rejecting too often the null hypothesis that only neutral processes structured spatially the local community) when the randomization algorithm breaks down a structure in the original data set unrelated to the null hypothesis to test. Hence, when overall species abundances are distributed non-randomly across the phylogeny or when local abundances are spatially autocorrelated, better statistical performances were achieved by randomization algorithms preserving these structural features. The most reliable randomization algorithm consists of permuting species with similar abundances among the tips of the phylogenetic tree. One metric, RPD-DO, also proved to be robust under most simulated conditions using a variety of null models.
* 5Synthesis. Given the suboptimal performances of several tests, attention must be paid to the testing procedures used in future studies. Guidelines are provided to help choosing an adequate test.},

abstract = {Ecologists have long sought a way to explain how the remarkable biodiversity observed in nature is maintained. On the one hand, simple models of interacting competitors cannot produce the stable persistence of very large ecological communities. On the other hand, neutral models, in which species do not interact and diversity is maintained by immigration and speciation, yield unrealistically small fluctuations in population abundance, and a strong positive correlation between a species' abundance and its age, contrary to empirical evidence. Models allowing for the robust persistence of large communities of interacting competitors are lacking. Here we show that very diverse communities could persist thanks to the stabilizing role of higher-order interactions, in which the presence of a species influences the interaction between other species. Although higher-order interactions have been studied for decades, their role in shaping ecological communities is still unclear. The inclusion of higher-order interactions in competitive network models stabilizes dynamics, making species coexistence robust to the perturbation of both population abundance and parameter values. We show that higher-order interactions have strong effects in models of closed ecological communities, as well as of open communities in which new species are constantly introduced. In our framework, higher-order interactions are completely defined by pairwise interactions, facilitating empirical parameterization and validation of our models.},

We applied predictive ecological niche modeling approaches to estimate and contrast niche divergence, overlap and breadth, and to identify key environmental variables associated with each species' niche for seven sister species with divergent mating systems. Data from 4862 geo-referenced herbarium occurrence records were compiled for 14 species in Collinsia and Tonella (Plantaginaceae) and 19 environmental variables associated with each record. We found sister species display significant niche divergence, though not as a function of divergence time, and overall, selfers have significantly wider niche breadths compared to their outcrossing sisters. Our results suggest that a selfing mating system likely contributes to the greater capacity to reach, reproduce, establish, and adapt to new habitats, which increases niche breadth of selfers.},

abstract = {Unveiling the genetic basis of local adaptation to environmental variation is a major goal in molecular ecology. In rugged landscapes characterized by environmental mosaics, living populations and communities can experience steep ecological gradients over very short geographical distances. In lowland tropical forests, interspecific divergence in edaphic specialization (for seasonally flooded bottomlands and seasonally dry terra firme soils) has been proven by ecological studies on adaptive traits. Some species are nevertheless capable of covering the entire span of the gradient; intraspecific variation for adaptation to contrasting conditions may explain the distribution of such ecological generalists. We investigated whether local divergence happens at small spatial scales in two stands of Eperua falcata (Fabaceae), a widespread tree species of the Guiana Shield. We investigated Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) and sequence divergence as well as spatial genetic structure (SGS) at four genes putatively involved in stress response and three genes with unknown function. Significant genetic differentiation was observed among sub-populations within stands, and eight SNP loci showed patterns compatible with disruptive selection. SGS analysis showed genetic turnover along the gradients at three loci, and at least one haplotype was found to be in repulsion with one habitat. Taken together, these results suggest genetic differentiation at small spatial scale in spite of gene flow. We hypothesize that heterogeneous environments may cause molecular divergence, possibly associated to local adaptation in E. falcata. {\textcopyright} 2012 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.},

abstract = {• Premise of the Study: Leaf area is a key trait that links plant form, function, and environment. Measures of leaf area can be biased because leaf area is often estimated from dried or fossilized specimens that have shrunk by an unknown amount. We tested the common assumption that this shrinkage is negligible.
• Methods: We measured shrinkage by comparing dry and fresh leaf area in 3401 leaves of 380 temperate and tropical species and used phylogenetic and trait-based approaches to determine predictors of this shrinkage. We also tested the effects of rehydration and simulated fossilization on shrinkage in four species.
• Key Results: We found that dried leaves shrink in area by an average of 22{\%} and a maximum of 82{\%}. Shrinkage in dried leaves can be predicted by multiple morphological traits with a standard deviation of 7.8{\%}. We also found that mud burial, a proxy for compression fossilization, caused negligible shrinkage, and that rehydration, a potential treatment of dried herbarium specimens, eliminated shrinkage.
• Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the amount of shrinkage is driven by variation in leaf area, leaf thickness, evergreenness, and woodiness and can be reversed by rehydration. The amount of shrinkage may also be a useful trait related to ecologically and physiological differences in drought tolerance and plant life history.},

abstract = {Many empirical studies have assessed fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS), i.e. the nonrandom spatial distribution of genotypes, within plant populations using genetic markers and spatial autocorrelation techniques. These studies mostly provided qualitative descriptions of SGS, rendering quantitative comparisons among studies difficult. The theory of isolation by distance can predict the pattern of SGS under limited gene dispersal, suggesting new approaches, based on the relationship between pairwise relatedness coefficients and the spatial distance between individuals, to quantify SGS and infer gene dispersal parameters. Here we review the theory underlying such methods and discuss issues about their application to plant populations, such as the choice of the relatedness statistics, the sampling scheme to adopt, the procedure to test SGS, and the interpretation of spatial autocorrelograms. We propose to quantify SGS by an 'Sp' statistic primarily dependent upon the rate of decrease of pairwise kinship coefficients between individuals with the logarithm of the distance in two dimensions. Under certain conditions, this statistic estimates the reciprocal of the neighbourhood size. Reanalysing data from, mostly, published studies, the Sp statistic was assessed for 47 plant species. It was found to be significantly related to the mating system (higher in selfing species) and to the life form (higher in herbs than trees), as well as to the population density (higher under low density). We discuss the necessity for comparing SGS with direct estimates of gene dispersal distances, and show how the approach presented can be extended to assess (i) the level of biparental inbreeding, and (ii) the kurtosis of the gene dispersal distribution.},

abstract = {The tropical Andes are a hotspot of biodiversity, but detailed altitudinal and latitudinal distribution patterns of species are poorly understood. We compare the distribution and diversity patterns of four Andean plant groups on the basis of georeferenced specimen data: the genus Nasa (Loasaceae), the two South American sections of Ribes (sect. Parilla and sect. Andina, Grossulariaceae), and the American clade of Urtica (Urticaceae). In the tropical Andes, these often grow together, especially in (naturally or anthropogenically) disturbed or secondary vegetation at middle to upper elevations. The climatic niches of the tropical groups studied here are relatively similar in temperature and temperature seasonality, but do differ in moisture seasonality. The Amotape-Huancabamba Zone (AHZ) between 3-8° S shows a clear diversity peak of overall species richness as well as for narrowly endemic species across the groups studied. For Nasa, we also show a particular diversity of growth forms in the AHZ. This can be interpreted as proxy for a high diversity of ecological niches based on high spatial habitat heterogeneity in this zone. Latitudinal ranges are generally larger towards the margins of overall range of the group. Species number and number of endemic species of our taxa peak at elevations of 2,500-3,500 m in the tropical Andes. Altitudinal diversity patterns correspond well with the altitudinal distribution of slope inclination. We hypothesize that the likelihood and frequency of landslides at steeper slopes translates into temporal habitat heterogeneity. The frequency of landslides may be causally connected to diversification especially for the numerous early colonizing taxa, such as Urtica and annual species of Nasa. In contrast to earlier hypotheses, uplift history is not reflected in the pattern here retrieved, since the AHZ is the area of the most recent Andean uplift. Similarly, a barrier effect of the low-lying Huancabamba depression is not retrieved in our d.},

abstract = {Climate, species composition, and soils are thought to control carbon cycling and forest structure in Amazonian forests. Here, we add a demographics scheme (tree recruitment, growth, and mortality) to a recently developed non-demographic model—the Trait-based Forest Simulator (TFS)—to explore the roles of climate and plant traits in controlling forest productivity and structure. We compared two sites with differing climates (seasonal vs. aseasonal precipitation) and plant traits. Through an initial validation simulation, we assessed whether the model converges on observed forest properties (productivity, demographic and structural variables) using datasets of functional traits, structure, and climate to model the carbon cycle at the two sites. In a second set of simulations, we tested the relative importance of climate and plant traits for forest properties within the TFS framework using the climate from the two sites with hypothetical trait distributions representing two axes of functional variation (“fast” vs. “slow” leaf traits, and high vs. low wood density). The adapted model with demographics reproduced observed variation in gross (GPP) and net (NPP) primary production, and respiration. However, NPP and respiration at the level of plant organs (leaf, stem, and root) were poorly simulated. Mortality and recruitment rates were underestimated. The equilibrium forest structure differed from observations of stem numbers suggesting either that the forests are not currently at equilibrium or that mechanisms are missing from the model. Findings from the second set of simulations demonstrated that differences in productivity were driven by climate, rather than plant traits. Contrary to expectation, varying leaf traits had no influence on GPP. Drivers of simulated forest structure were complex, with a key role for wood density mediated by its link to tree mortality. Modeled mortality and recruitment rates were linked to plant traits alone, drought-related mortality was not accounted for. In future, model development should focus on improving allocation, mortality, organ respiration, simulation of understory trees and adding hydraulic traits. This type of model that incorporates diverse tree strategies, detailed forest structure and realistic physiology is necessary if we are to be able to simulate tropical forest responses to global change scenarios.},

This review discusses sources and patterns of intraspecific trait variation and their consequences for understanding how ecological processes and patterns will respond to global change. We examine how current ecological models and theories incorporate intraspecific variation, review existing data sources that could help parameterize models that account for intraspecific variation in global change predictions, and discuss new data that may be needed. We provide guidelines on when it is most important to consider intraspecific variation, such as when trait variation is heritable or when non-linear relationships are involved. We also highlight benefits and limitations of different model types, and argue that many common modeling approaches such as matrix population models or global dynamic vegetation models would allow a stronger consideration of intraspecific trait variation if the necessary data were available. We recommend that existing data needs to be made more accessible, and in some case new experiments are needed to disentangle causes of variation.},

abstract = {* Collecting leaves or seeds from tall trees is a difficult task that many plant physiologists, ecologists, geneticists and forest managers encounter repeatedly. Tree branches are often much higher than a cutting pole or saw can reach. When this happens, the most common solutions involve the use of sharp-shooters, cherry pickers (a.k.a. bucket trucks) or tree climbers. All of these methods can be expense, logistically complicated, and often involve additional permits and licences. * We present a cost-effective and simple alternative for collecting leaves and seeds from tall trees using an arborist throw-line launcher. An arborist throw-line launcher is traditionally used to throw a rope over high branches for tree climbing. However, the same instrument can be used to collect leaves and seeds from trees without the need for climbing. * In the course of sampling over 4000 trees from a variety of species across multiple continents, we have developed several techniques to optimize leaf and seed sampling with a throw-line launcher at heights up to 40 m. We present these techniques along with several time-saving tips and tricks to increase sampling efficiency and reduce the occurrence of lost weight bags, broken ropes, and hung branches that will not fall. * These techniques remove many of the limitations commonly associated with sampling leaves and seeds from tall trees with more traditional methods. Without these limitations, the costs, risks and time associated with this type of data collection are reduced.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 British Ecological Society. Individual-level interactions with neighbours and their surrounding environments are key factors influencing performance that ultimately shape and maintain diversity in tropical plant communities. Theory predicts that the strength of these interactions depends on the similarity among neighbours, the turnover in composition caused by individuals that enter as new recruits and individuals that die, and fitting to local conditions. Despite considerable phenotypic variation among individuals and high community dynamics, these three factors have rarely been considered together for understanding growth variation, especially for seedling communities in the tropics. We address this outstanding challenge by quantifying the influence of trait dissimilarity among neighbours, temporal turnover in neighbours, and individual trait variation on seedling growth, based on an unprecedented dataset containing individual-level demographic and functional trait data for tropical tree seedlings. The results showed that trait dissimilarity associated with resource acquisition does not influence growth. However, conspecific negative density-dependent effects on growth were evident through the initial density of conspecifics and the increase in conspecifics during the study period. Also, individuals with relatively larger investments in leaf biomass allocation attained higher growth rates, suggesting that seedlings adjust their resource allocation to tissues related with light capture. Synthesis. Together, these findings indicate that tropical seedling communities are structured by local abiotic factors that ultimately result in individual variation in resource acquisition traits and by biotic interactions driven by negative density dependence. These biotic interactions are highly dynamic and depend on conspecifics turnover, even at short temporal scales. Thus, to gain further insights into the forces structuring seedling communities, future studies should account for temporal variability in immediate neighbours and individual-level phenotypic variation that influence individual interactions.},

abstract = {Eucalyptus globulus is an important species for pulpwood production in many countries. The pattern and partitioning of variation is important baseline knowledge for tree breeding. Currently the species is divided into four subspecies: globulus, bicostata, pseudoglobulus and maidenii. Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to analyse variation in 173 representatives of 37 natural populations of E. globulus: 31 localities of ssp. globulus (148 individuals), two localities each of ssp. bicostata (nine individuals), ssp. maidenii (ten individuals) and ssp. pseudoglobulus (six individuals). Ten 10-mer primers amplified a total of 162 scorable bands, of which 149 (91.9 per cent) were polymorphic. AMOVA analysis of a Euclidean distance matrix based on presence/absence of polymorphic bands found most variation within localities, but significant differences between localities and regions. Principal components analysis (PCA) identified a major latitudinal dine in RAPD phenotype that differentiated southern Tasmanian localities from other ssp. globulus localities on mainland Australia. Many localities previously identified as intermediate between subspecies globulus and other subspecies in morphology were not intermediate in RAPD phenotype. In some cases regions which showed marked differentiation between localities in capsule and juvenile leaf morphology showed little RAPD differentiation between localities. RAPDs also provided new insights into the affinities of outlying localities. Although RAPD technology has not yet been applied to many forest tree species, patterns of varia-tion were similar to those found in other outcrossing species studied using both RAPDs and other molecular markers.},

abstract = {In this paper two geomorphologic maps (landform level and landscape level) are presented covering the French Guianan rainforest (84,000 km2) using full-resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data. The entire country was segmented into 224,000 landform units on the basis of an original object-oriented approach using a modified counting box algorithm. A Principal Components Analysis (PCA) followed by k-means clustering (Ward's method) identified 12 different landform types corresponding to theoretical elementary landforms. The landscape map was generated by analyzing the spatial distribution of the different landform types. The different maps and models were compared with topographic field data collected on 92 transects totaling 260 km in length. The object-focused approach is a very efficient method that preserves geomorphologic consistency and discriminates between landforms using simple descriptors that are easily understood by non-geomorphologists. Despite major noise in the data, the landform map proved to be reliable and provided a strong spatial structure for the definition of landscape units. We recommend using the landform map at scales 1: 100,000-1: 250,000. Landscape map, used on a 1:1,000,000-1:2,000,000 scale, enabled us to draw bio-geographical limits in this region and provides exhaustive relief information that usefully supplements the geological map. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright ONF.},

Under dry air conditions diffusion resistance increases. Under moist air conditions diffusion resistance decreases. When the stomata close at low air humidity the water content of the apricot leaves increases. The stomata open at high air humidity in spite of a decrease in leaf water content. This excludes a reaction via the water potential in the leaf tissue and proves that the stomatal aperture has a direct response to the evaporative conditions in the atmosphere. In all species the response to air humidity is maintained over a period of many hours also when the soil is considerably dry. The response is higher in plants with poor water supply then in well watered plants. Thus for field conditions and for morphologically different types of photosynthesizing organs the results confirm former experiments carried out with isolated epidermal strips. {\textcopyright} 1972 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Question Which functional diversity indices have the power to reveal changes in community assembly processes along abiotic stress gradients? Is their power affected by stochastic processes and variations in species richness along stress gradients? Methods We used a simple community assembly model to explore the power of functional diversity indices across a wide range of ecological contexts. The model assumes that with declining stress the influence of niche complementarity on species fitness increases while that of environmental filtering decreases. We separately incorporated two trait-independent stochastic processes – mass and priority effects – in simulating species occurrences and abundances along a hypothetical stress gradient. We ran simulations where species richness was constant along the gradient, or increased, decreased or varied randomly with declining stress. We compared observed values for two indices of functional richness – total functional dendrogram length (FD) and convex hull volume (FRic) – with a matrix-swap null model (yielding indices SESFD and SESFRic) to remove any trivial effects of species richness. We also compared two indices that measure both functional richness and functional divergence – Rao quadratic entropy (Rao) and functional dispersion (FDis) – with a null model that randomizes abundances across species but within communities. This converts them to pure measures of functional divergence (SESRao and SESFDis). Results When mass effects operated, only SESRao and SESFDis gave reasonable power, irrespective of how species richness varied along the stress gradient. FD, FRic, Rao and FDis had low power when species richness was constant, and variation in species richness greatly influenced their power. SESFRic and SESFD were unaffected by variation in species richness. When priority effects operated, FRic, SESFRic, Rao and FDis had good power and were unaffected by variation in species richness. Variation in species richness greatly affected FD and SESFD. SESRao and SESFDis had low power in the priority effects model but were unaffected by variation in species richness. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that a reliable test for changes in assembly processes along stress gradients requires functional diversity indices measuring either functional richness or functional divergence. We recommend using SESFRic as a measure of functional richness and either SESRao or SESFDis (which are very closely related mathematically) as a measure of functional divergence. Used together, these indices of functional richness and functional divergence provide good power to test for increasing niche complementarity with declining stress across a broad range of ecological contexts.},

However, extant methods to sample from hypervolumes or measure their geometry perform poorly on high-dimensional or holey datasets. Innovation We first highlight the conceptual and computational issues that have prevented a more direct approach to measuring hypervolumes. Next, we present a new multivariate kernel density estimation method that resolves many of these problems in an arbitrary number of dimensions. Main conclusions We show that our method (implemented as the ‘hypervolume' R package) can match several extant methods for hypervolume geometry and species distribution modelling. Tools to quantify high-dimensional ecological hypervolumes will enable a wide range of fundamental descriptive, inferential and comparative questions to be addressed.},

abstract = {The ecological consequences of climate change for large tropical forests such as the Amazon are likely to be profound. Amazonian forests strongly influence regional and global climates and therefore any changes in forest structure, such as deforestation or die-back, may create positive feedback on externally forced climate change. Monitoring, modelling and managing the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on forest dynamics is therefore an important objective of forest researchers, and one that requires long-term data on changes at the level of community, populations and phenotypes. In this paper we provide the most comprehensive study yet on the seasonal dynamics of various leaf traits: leaf area index (LAI), leaf mortality (LM), leaf biomass (LB), leaf growth rate (LG), and leaf residence time (TR) from 50 experimental plots in a forest site at Belterra, Par??

abstract = {Trees grow tall where resources are abundant, stresses are minor, and competition for light places a premium on height growth. The height to which trees can grow and the biophysical determinants of maximum height are poorly understood. Some models predict heights of up to 120 m in the absence of mechanical damage, but there are historical accounts of taller trees. Current hypotheses of height limitation focus on increasing water transport constraints in taller trees and the resulting reductions in leaf photosynthesis. We studied redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens), including the tallest known tree on Earth (112.7 m), in wet temperate forests of northern California. Our regression analyses of height gradients in leaf functional characteristics estimate a maximum tree height of 122-130 m barring mechanical damage, similar to the tallest recorded trees of the past. As trees grow taller, increasing leaf water stress due to gravity and path length resistance may ultimately limit leaf expansion and photosynthesis for further height growth, even with ample soil moisture.},

abstract = {State-space models (SSMs) are an important modeling framework for analyzing ecological time series. These hierarchical models are commonly used to model population dynamics and animal movement, and are now increasingly being used to model other ecological processes. SSMs are popular because they are flexible and they model the natural variation in ecological processes separately from observation error. Their flexibility allows ecologists to model continuous, count, binary, and categorical data with linear or nonlinear processes that evolve in discrete or continuous time. Modeling the two sources of stochasticity separately allows researchers to differentiate between biological stochasticity (e.g., in birth processes) and imprecision in the sampling methodology, and generally provides better estimates of the ecological quantities of interest than if only one source of stochasticity is directly modeled. Since the introduction of SSMs, a broad range of fitting procedures have been proposed. However, the variety and complexity of these procedures can limit the ability of ecologists to formulate and fit their own SSMs. In addition, many SSM users are unaware of the potential estimation problems they could encounter, and of the model selection and validation tools that can help them assess how well their models fit their data. In this paper, we present a review of SSMs that will provide a strong foundation to ecologists interested in learning about SSMs, introduce new tools to veteran SSM users, and highlight promising research directions for statisticians interested in ecological applications. The review is accompanied by an in-depth tutorial that demonstrates how SSMs models can be fitted and validated in R. Together, the review and tutorial present an introduction to SSMs that will help ecologists to formulate, fit, and validate their models.},

abstract = {Mutations are the ultimate source of all genetic variation. However, few direct estimates of the contribution of mutation to molecular genetic variation are available. To address this issue, we first analyzed the rate and spectrum of mutations in the Arabidopsis thaliana reference accession after 25 generations of single-seed descent. We then compared the mutation profile in these mutation accumulation (MA) lines against genetic variation observed in the 1001 Genomes Project. The estimated haploid single nucleotide mutation (SNM) rate for A. thaliana is 6.95 3 10 29 (SE 6 2.68 3 10 210 ) per site per generation, with SNMs having higher frequency in transposable elements (TEs) and centromeric regions. The estimated indel mutation rate is 1.30 3 10 29 (61.07 3 10 210 ) per site per generation, with deletions being more frequent and larger than insertions. Among the 1694 unique SNMs identified in the MA lines, the positions of 389 SNMs (23{\%}) coincide with biallelic SNPs from the 1001 Genomes population, and in 289 (17{\%}) cases the changes are identical. Of the 329 unique indels identified in the MA lines, 96 (29{\%}) overlap with indels from the 1001 Genomes dataset, and 16 indels (5{\%} of the total) are identical. These overlap frequencies are significantly higher than expected, suggesting that de novo mutations are not uniformly distributed and arise at polymorphic sites more frequently than assumed. These results suggest that high mutation rate potentially contributes to high polymorphism and low mutation rate to reduced polymorphism in natural populations providing insights of mutational inputs in generating natural genetic diversity.},

abstract = {Positive selection can be inferred from its effect on linked neutral variation. In the restrictive case when there is no recombination, all linked variation is removed. If recombination is present but rare, both deterministic and stochastic models of positive selection show that linked variation hitchhikes to either low or high frequencies. While the frequency distribution of variation can be influenced by a number of evolutionary processes, an excess of derived variants at high frequency is a unique pattern produced by hitchhiking (derived refers to the nonancestral state as determined from an outgroup). We adopt a statistic, H, to measure an excess of high compared to intermediate frequency variants. Only a few high- frequency variants are needed to detect hitchhiking since not many are expected under neutrality. This is of particular utility in regions of low recombination where there is not much variation and in regions of normal or high recombination, where the hitchhiking effect can be limited to a small ({\textless}1 kb) region. Application of the H test to published surveys of Drosophila variation reveals an excess of high frequency variants that are likely to have been influenced by positive selection.},

We gathered data on six traits: dispersal mode, nitrogen fixation, deciduousness, leaf area, wood density and maximum diameter.

abstract = {Tropical forests are generally considered to stand upon nutrient-poor soils, but soil nutrient concentrations and availabilities can vary greatly at local scale due to topographic effects on erosion and water drainage. In this study we physically and chemically characterised the soils of 12 study plots situated along a catena with a shallow slope in a tropical rainforest in French Guiana both during the wet and the dry season to evaluate seasonal differences. Soils along the catena were all Acrisols, but differed strongly in their water drainage flux. Over time, this differential drainage has led to differences in soil texture and mineral composition, affecting the adsorption of various nutrients, most importantly phosphorus. The more clayey soils situated on the slope of the catena had higher total concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and several micronutrients, while extractable nutrient concentrations were highest in the sandiest soils situated at the bottom of the catena. We found that carbon, nitrogen and extractable nutrients all varied seasonally, especially in the surface soil layer. These results are interesting because they show that, even at the local scale, small differences in topography can lead to large heterogeneity in nutrient concentrations, which can have large impacts on plant and microbial community organisation at the landscape level.},

Then we discuss reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments designed to detect local adaptation in the pattern of deme × habitat interaction for fitness. Finally, we review research questions and approaches to studying the processes of local adaptation – divergent natural selection, dispersal and gene flow, and other processes affecting adaptive differentiation of local demes. We advocate multifaceted approaches to the study of local adaptation, and stress the need for experiments explicitly addressing hypotheses about the role of particular ecological and genetic factors that promote or hinder local adaptation. Experimental evolution of replicated populations in controlled spatially heterogeneous environments allow direct tests of such hypotheses, and thus would be a valuable way to complement research on natural populations.},

abstract = {The geographic distribution throughout Europe of each of 32 chloroplast DNA variants belonging to eight white oak species sampled from 2613 populations is presented. Clear-cut geographic patterns were revealed by the survey. These distributions, together with the available palynological information, were used to infer colonisation routes out of the glacial period refugia. In western Europe in particular, movements out of the Iberian and the Italian Peninsulas can be clearly identified. Separate refugia are also present in eastern Balkans, whereas further west in this peninsula similarities with Italy were evident. Movements resulting in the exchange of haplotypes between refugia both during the present interglacial and probably also during earlier glacial cycles were therefore inferred. The consequences of these past exchanges is that phylogenetically divergent haplotypes have sometimes followed very similar colonisation routes, limiting somewhat the phylogeographic structure. Cases of geographic disjunction in the present-day distribution of haplotypes are also apparent and could have been induced by the existence of rapid climatic changes at the end of the glacial period (specifically the Younger Dryas cold period), which resulted in range restriction following an early warm period during which oak first expanded from its primary refugia. This cold phase was followed by a new period of expansion at the outset of the Holocene, involving in some cases 'secondary' refugia. It is expected that these short climate oscillations would have led to a partial reshuffling of haplotype distribution. Early association between haplotypes and oak species are also suggested by the data, although extensive introgression among species has ultimately largely blurred the pattern. This implies that colonisation routes may have been initially constrained by the ecological characteristics of the species hosting each chloroplast variant. We suggest for instance that two oak species distributed in the north of the Iberian Peninsula (Quercus petraea and Q. pubescens) are recent post-glacial immigrants there. When considered together, conclusions on the location of glacial period refugia and the colonisation routes derived from molecular information and fossil pollen data appear to be both largely compatible and complementary. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We resolved the sequences of relative water content and leaf water potential $\Psi$leaf thresholds of functional impairment. On average, losses of leaf rehydration capacity occurred at dehydration beyond 50{\%} declines of gs, Kleaf and turgor loss point. Losses of Fv/Fm occurred after much stronger dehydration and were not recovered with leaf rehydration. Across species, tissue dehydration thresholds were intercorrelated, suggesting trait co-selection. Thresholds for each type of functional decline were much less variable across species in terms of relative water content than $\Psi$leaf. The stomatal and leaf hydraulic systems show early functional declines before cell integrity is lost. Substantial damage to the photochemical apparatus occurs at extreme dehydration, after complete stomatal closure, and seems to be irreversible.},

We assembled high-quality draft genomes of two different Eucalyptus species E. rudis, and E. camaldulensis to chromosome level without using additional scaffolding technologies. For the rapid production of de novo genome assembly of plant species we showed that our DNA extraction protocol followed by PacBio high fidelity sequencing, and assembly with new generation assemblers such as hifiasm produce excellent results.

By analysing worldwide variation in six major traits critical to growth, survival and reproduction within the largest sample of vascular plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy of six-dimensional trait space is strongly concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs. Three- quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global spectrum of plant form and function.

abstract = {There is growing recognition that classifying terrestrial plant species on the basis of their function (into 'functional types') rather than their higher taxonomic identity, is a promising way forward for tackling important ecological questions at the scale of ecosystems, landscapes or biomes. These questions include those on vegetation responses to and vegetation effects on, environmental changes (e.g. changes in climate, atmospheric chemistry, land use or other disturbances). There is also growing consensus about a shortlist of plant traits that should underlie such functional plant classifications, because they have strong predictive power of important ecosystem responses to environmental change and/or they themselves have strong impacts on ecosystem processes. The most favoured traits are those that are also relatively easy and inexpensive to measure for large numbers of plant species. Large international research efforts, promoted by the IGBP–GCTE Programme, are underway to screen predominant plant species in various ecosystems and biomes worldwide for such traits. This paper provides an international methodological protocol aimed at standardising this research effort, based on consensus among a broad group of scientists in this field. It features a practical handbook with step-by-step recipes, with relatively brief information about the ecological context, for 28 functional traits recognised as critical for tackling large-scale ecological questions.},

abstract = {Forest trees have gained much attention in recent years as nonclassical model eukaryotes for population, evolutionary and ecological genomic studies. Because of low domestication, large open-pollinated native populations, and high levels of both genetic and phenotypic variation, they are ideal organisms to unveil the molecular basis of population adaptive divergence in nature. Population genomics, in its broad-sense definition, is an emerging discipline that combines genome-wide sampling with traditional population genetic approaches to understanding evolution. Here we briefly review traditional methods of studying adaptive genetic variation in forest trees, and describe a new, integrated population genomics approach. First, alleles (haplotypes) at candidate genes for adaptive traits and their effects on phenotypes need to be characterized via sequencing and association mapping. At this stage, functional genomics can assist in understanding gene action and regulation by providing detailed transcriptional profiles. Second, frequencies of alleles in native populations for causative single-nucleotide polymorphisms are estimated to identify patterns of adaptive variation across heterogeneous environments. Population genomics, through deciphering allelic effects on phenotypes and identifying patterns of adaptive variation at the landscape level, will in the future constitute a useful tool, if cost-effective, to design conservation strategies for forest trees. {\textcopyright} New Phytologist (2006).},

Despite numerous experimental and phenomenological investigations, the extent to which such mechanisms operate in tropical forests remains unresolved because the demographical signature of density dependence has rarely been found in extensive investigations of established trees. This study used an individual-based demographical approach to investigate the role of conspecific and heterospecific neighbourhood crowding on tree mortality in a Panamanian and a Malayan tropical forest. More than 80{\%} of the species investigated at each site were found to exhibit density-dependent mortality. Furthermore, most of these species showed patterns of mortality consistent with the Janzen–Connell hypothesis and the rarely explored hypothesis of species herd protection. This study presents some of the first evidence of species herd protection operating in tree communities.},

abstract = {Aim Modelling species distributions at the community level is required to make effective forecasts of global change impacts on diversity and ecosystem functioning. Community predictions may be achieved using macroecological properties of communities (macroecological models, MEM), or by stacking of individual species distribution models (stacked species distribution models, S-SDMs). To obtain more realistic predictions of species assemblages, the SESAM (spatially explicit species assemblage modelling) framework suggests applying successive filters to the initial species source pool, by combining different modelling approaches and rules. Here we provide a first test of this framework in mountain grassland communities. Location The western Swiss Alps. Methods Two implementations of the SESAM framework were tested: a ‘probability ranking' rule based on species richness predictions and rough probabilities from SDMs, and a ‘trait range' rule that uses the predicted upper and lower bound of community-level distribution of three different functional traits (vegetative height, specific leaf area, and seed mass) to constrain a pool of species from binary SDMs predictions. Results We showed that all independent constraints contributed to reduce species richness overprediction. Only the ‘probability ranking' rule allowed slight but significant improvements in the predictions of community composition. Main conclusions We tested various implementations of the SESAM framework by integrating macroecological constraints into S-SDM predictions, and report one that is able to improve compositional predictions. We discuss possible improvements, such as further understanding the causality and precision of environmental predictors, using other assembly rules and testing other types of ecological or functional constraints.},

abstract = {1 Successional replacement of intolerant species by shade tolerators along gap-understorey gradients is commonly associated with increasingly higher low-light carbon acquisition capacities of more tolerant species. This doctrine has recently been challenged because of evidence demonstrating larger leaf dry mass per unit area (MA), lower photosynthetic capacities and inferior whole plant relative growth rates (RGR) in both high and low irradiance in seedlings of shade-tolerators. However, as the individuals of shade-tolerant species often need to endure canopy shade for many years before gap formation, testing of the carbon gain hypothesis of shade tolerance requires examination of species carbon gain potentials during the entire plant ontogeny. 2 Light vs. MA relationships throughout ontogeny demonstrate that saplings and canopy individuals of shade tolerators do have lower MA than intolerant species, and moderately higher photosynthetic capacities in low light, resulting in greater whole plant carbon gain capacities at lower light. The apparent discrepancy between results from studies on seedlings vs. saplings/trees is due to MA increasing at a faster rate in shade intolerators during ontogeny. A strong positive linkage between seed size and species shade tolerance further implies that shade tolerators have larger initial size, absolute growth rate and survivorship in low light despite their lower RGR. 3 The evidence reviewed collectively suggests that the carbon balance concept of species' successional position is valid for both seedlings and saplings, and that the apparent discrepancies in species rankings on the basis of structural and physiological charac-teristics are driven by variations in initial size and rate of ontogeny. Analyses of species shade tolerance potentials should therefore consider how any suite of adaptive traits varies with ontogeny.},

Admixture mapping can be used to identify the number and effect sizes of genes that contribute to the divergence of ecologically important traits, even in taxa that are not amenable to laboratory crosses because of their long generation time or other limitations. Here, we apply admixture mapping to naturally occurring hybrids between two ecologically divergent Populus species. We map quantitative trait loci for eight leaf morphological traits using 77 mapped microsatellite markers from all 19 chromosomes of Populus. We apply multivariate linear regression analysis allowing the modeling of additive and non-additive gene action and identify several candidate genomic regions associated with leaf morphology using an information-theoretic approach. We perform simulation studies to assess the power and limitations of admixture mapping of quantitative traits in natural hybrid populations for a variety of genetic architectures and modes of gene action. Our results indicate that (1) admixture mapping has considerable power to identify the genetic architecture of species differences if sample sizes and marker densities are sufficiently high, (2) modeling of non-additive gene action can help to elucidate the discrepancy between genotype and phenotype sometimes seen in interspecific hybrids, and (3) the genetic architecture of leaf morphological traits in the studied Populus species involves complementary and overdominant gene action, providing the basis for rapid adaptation of these ecologically important forest trees.},

abstract = {? 2016 British Ecological Society.A plant's growth rate is seen as a central element of its ecological strategy, and as determined by its traits. Yet the literature is inconsistent about the empirical correlation between functional traits and growth, casting doubt on the capacity of some prominent traits to influence growth rate. We propose that traits should influence growth in a way that depends on the size of individual plants. We outline mechanisms and hypotheses based on new theoretical work and test these predictions in tree species using a meta-analysis of 103 studies ({\textgreater} 500 correlations) for five traits (specific leaf area, wood density, maximum height, seed mass and maximum assimilation rate). We also recorded data for 14 other traits commonly used in the trait literature. To capture the effects of plant size, we tested for a shift in the direction of correlation between growth rates and each trait across three ontogenetic stages: seedling, sapling and adult. Results were consistent with predictions, although there were some limitations arising from unequal numbers of observation across ontogenetic stages. Specific leaf area was correlated with relative growth rate in seedlings but not in adult plants. Correlations of growth with wood density were not affected by ontogenetic stage. Seed mass, assimilation rate and maximum height were correlated with relative growth rate only in one ontogenetic stage category: seedlings, seedlings and adults, respectively. Although we were able to confirm several of our theoretical predictions, major knowledge gaps still exist in the trait literature. For example, for one-third of the traits considered, the majority ({\textgreater} 75{\%}) of reported correlations with growth came from the same ontogenetic stage. Synthesis. We show for some traits, how trait-growth correlations change in a predictable way with plant size. Our understanding of plant strategies should shift away from describing species as having a fixed growth strategy throughout their life (on a continuous axis from slow to fast growth), in favour of a size-dependent growth trajectories.},

abstract = {Background: Hybridization and polyploidy are central processes in evolution and speciation. These mechanisms often lead to complex patterns of genetic variation and the creation of novel genotypes, which may establish if they become isolated from gene flow. However, in the absence of reproductive isolation, species boundaries might easily be disrupted. Here, we used a combination of AFLPs, chloroplast DNA markers and flow cytometry to investigate the evolutionary outcomes of hybridization between two endemic Ecuadorian species of Epidendrum (E. madsenii and E. rhopalostele) in three hybrid zones. Postmating isolation was also quantified to determine the role of this barrier in restraining gene flow between hybrids and the parental species. In addition, future ecological niche models were constructed to predict the outcomes of hybridization between these species. Results: Our results confirmed the presence of hybrids in all hybrid zones, but revealed that a third parental species (E. falcisepalum) has contributed to one of the hybrid zones studied. Backcross genotypes were frequent in all hybrid zones, which was in accordance with the absence of strong reproductive barriers. The process of hybridization was highly asymmetric and followed in some cases by polyploidy. The projection of future niche models predicted a severe reduction in the area suitable for the occurrence of these species, although favorable conditions will still occur for the existence of the current hybrid zones. Conclusions: The recurrent process of hybridization has compromised the genetic integrity of the parental species. Most individuals of the parental species can no longer be considered as pure-bred individuals because most were classified as backcrossed hybrids. Novel genetic lineages occur in all hybrid zones implying that hybrids are fertile and can compete with the parental species. These results, together with the prediction of suitable conditions for the future occurrence of these hybrid zones, highlight the importance of conserving these geographic areas as sources of novel taxonomic entities. {\textcopyright} 2014 Marques et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Functional diversity (FD) is an important component of biodiversity that quantifies the difference in functional traits between organisms. However, FD studies are often limited by the availability of trait data and FD indices are sensitive to data gaps. The distribution of species abundance and trait data, and its transformation, may further affect the accuracy of indices when data is incomplete. Using an existing approach, we simulated the effects of missing trait data by gradually removing data from a plant, an ant and a bird community dataset (12, 59, and 8 plots containing 62, 297 and 238 species respectively). We ranked plots by FD values calculated from full datasets and then from our increasingly incomplete datasets and compared the ranking between the original and virtually reduced datasets to assess the accuracy of FD indices when used on datasets with increasingly missing data. Finally, we tested the accuracy of FD indices with and without data transformation, and the effect of missing trait data per plot or per the whole pool of species. FD indices became less accurate as the amount of missing data increased, with the loss of accuracy depending on the index. But, where transformation improved the normality of the trait data, FD values from incomplete datasets were more accurate than before transformation. The distribution of data and its transformation are therefore as important as data completeness and can even mitigate the effect of missing data. Since the effect of missing trait values pool-wise or plot-wise depends on the data distribution, the method should be decided case by case. Data distribution and data transformation should be given more careful consideration when designing, analysing and interpreting FD studies, especially where trait data are missing. To this end, we provide the R package "traitor" to facilitate assessments of missing trait data.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic comparative methods have long considered phylogenetic signal as a source of statistical bias in the correlative analysis of biological traits. However, the main life-history strategies existing in a set of taxa are often combinations of life history traits that are inherently phylogenetically structured. In this paper, we present a method for identifying evolutionary strategies from large sets of biological traits, using phylogeny as a source of meaningful historical and ecological information. Our methodology extends a multivariate method developed for the analysis of spatial patterns, and relies on finding combinations of traits that are phylogenetically autocorrelated. Using extensive simulations, we show that our method efficiently uncovers phylogenetic structures with respect to various tree topologies, and remains powerful in cases where a large majority of traits are not phylogenetically structured. Our methodology is illustrated using empirical data, and implemented in the adephylo package for the free software R.},

abstract = {1. A recent experiment varied the genetic diversity of model grassland communities under standardized soil and management conditions and at constant initial species diversity. After 5 years' growth, genetically diverse communities retained more species diversity and became more similar in species composition than genetically impover- ished communities. 2. Here we present the results of further investigation within this experimental system. We proposed that two mechanisms – the first invoking genetically determined and con- stant differences in plant phenotypes and the second invoking genotype–environment interactions – could each underpin these results. This mechanistic framework was used as a tool to interpret our findings. 3. We used inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) DNA markers to confirm which of the individuals of six study species initially included in the model communities were unique genotypes. We then used the molecular markers to assess the survival and abundance of each genotype at the end of the 5-year experimental period. 4. The DNA marker data were used to create, for the first time, a genotype abundance hierarchy describing the structure of a community at the level of genotypes. This abun- dance hierarchy revealed wide variation in the abundance of genotypes within species, and large overlaps in the performance of the genotypes of different species. 5. Each genotype achieved a consistent level of abundance within genetically diverse communities, which differed from that attained by other genotypes of the same species. The abundance hierarchy of genotypes within species also showed consistency across communities differing in their initial level of genetic diversity, such that species abundance in genetically impoverished communities could be predicted, in part, by genotypic identity. 6. Three species (including two canopy-dominants) experienced shifts in their community- level genotype abundance hierarchies that were consistent with an increased influence of genotype–environment interactions in genetically impoverished communities. 7. Our results indicate that under relatively constant environmental conditions the species abundance structure of plant communities can in part be predicted from the genotypic composition of their component populations. Genotype–environment inter- actions also appear to shape the structure of communities under such conditions, although further experiments are needed to clarify the magnitude and mechanism of these effects.},

abstract = {Oaks are an important part of our natural and cultural heritage. Not only are they ubiquitous in our most common landscapes 1 but they have also supplied human societies with invaluable services, including food and shelter, since prehistoric times 2 . With 450 species spread throughout Asia, Europe and America 3, oaks constitute a critical global renewable resource. The longevity of oaks (several hundred years) probably underlies their emblematic cultural and historical importance. Such long-lived sessile organisms must persist in the face of a wide range of abiotic and biotic threats over their lifespans. We investigated the genomic features associated with such a long lifespan by sequencing, assembling and annotating the oak genome. We then used the growing number of whole-genome sequences for plants (including tree and herbaceous species) to investigate the parallel evolution of genomic characteristics potentially underpinning tree longevity. A further consequence of the long lifespan of trees is their accumulation of somatic mutations during mitotic divisions of stem cells present in the shoot apical meristems. Empirical 4 and modelling 5 approaches have shown that intra-organismal genetic heterogeneity can be selected for 6 and provides direct fitness benefits in the arms race with short-lived pests and pathogens through a patchwork of intra-organismal phenotypes 7 . However, there is no clear proof that large-statured trees consist of a genetic mosaic of clonally distinct cell lineages within and between branches. Through this case study of oak, we demonstrate the accumulation and transmission of somatic mutations and the expansion of disease-resistance gene families in trees.},

abstract = {Species distribution is strongly driven by local and global gradients in water availability but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Vulnerability to xylem embolism (P 50 ) is a key trait that indicates how species cope with drought and might explain plant distribution patterns across environmental gradients. Here we address its role on species sorting along a hydro-topographical gradient in a central Amazonian rainforest and examine its variance at the community scale. We measured P 50 for 28 tree species, soil properties and estimated the hydrological niche of each species using an indicator of distance to the water table (HAND). We found a large hydraulic diversity, covering as much as 44{\%} of the global angiosperm variation in P 50 . We show that P 50 : contributes to species segregation across a hydro-topographic gradient in the Amazon, and thus to species coexistence; is the result of repeated evolutionary adaptation within closely related taxa; is associated with species tolerance to P-poor soils, suggesting the evolution of a stress-tolerance syndrome to nutrients and drought; and is higher for trees in the valleys than uplands. The large observed hydraulic diversity and its association with topography has important implications for modelling and predicting forest and species resilience to climate change.},

abstract = {Interspecific differentiation values (GST) between two closely related oak species (Quercus petraea and Q. robur) were compiled across different studies with the aim to explore the distribution of differentiation at the genome level. The study was based on a total set of 389 markers (isozymes, AFLPs, SCARs, microsatellites, and SNPs) for which allelic frequencies were estimated in pairs of populations sampled throughout the sympatric distribution of the two species. The overall distribution of GST values followed an L-shaped curve with most markers exhibiting low species differentiation (GST {\textless} 0.01) and only a few loci reaching {\textgreater}10{\%} levels. Twelve percent of the loci exhibited significant GST deviations to neutral expectations, suggesting that selection contributed to species divergence. Coding regions expressed higher differentiation than noncoding regions. Among the 389 markers, 158 could be mapped on the 12 linkage groups of the existing Q. robur genetic map. Outlier loci with large GST values were distributed over 9 linkage groups. One cluster of three outlier loci was found within 0.51 cM; but significant autocorrelation of GST was observed at distances {\textless}2 cM. The size and distribution of genomic regions involved in species divergence are discussed in reference to hitchhiking effects and disruptive selection.},

abstract = {How Quaternary climatic and geological disturbances influenced the composition of Neotropical forests is hotly debated. Rainfall and temperature changes during and/or immediately after the last glacial maximum (LGM) are thought to have strongly affected the geographical distribution and local abundance of tree species. The paucity of the fossil records in Neotropical forests prevents a direct reconstruction of such processes. To describe community-level historical trends in forest composition, we turned therefore to inferential methods based on the reconstruction of past demographic changes. In particular, we modelled the history of rainforests in the eastern Guiana Shield over a timescale of several thousand generations, through the application of approximate Bayesian computation and maximum-likelihood methods to diversity data at nuclear and chloroplast loci in eight species or subspecies of rainforest trees. Depending on the species and on the method applied, we detected population contraction, expansion or stability, with a general trend in favour of stability or expansion, with changes presumably having occurred during or after the LGM. These findings suggest that Guiana Shield rainforests have globally persisted, while expanding, through the Quaternary, but that different species have experienced different demographic events, with a trend towards the increase in frequency of light-demanding, disturbance-associated species.},

The speciation genomic literature, however, is mainly a collection of case studies, each with its own approach and specificities, such that a global view of the gradual process of evolution from one to two species is currently lacking. Of primary importance is the prevalence of gene flow between diverging entities, which is central in most species concepts and has been widely discussed in recent years. Here, we explore the continuum of speciation thanks to a comparative analysis of genomic data from 61 pairs of populations/species of animals with variable levels of divergence. Gene flow between diverging gene pools is assessed under an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework. We show that the intermediate "grey zone" of speciation, in which taxonomy is often controversial, spans from 0.5{\%} to 2{\%} of net synonymous divergence, irrespective of species life history traits or ecology. Thanks to appropriate modeling of among-locus variation in genetic drift and introgression rate, we clarify the status of the majority of ambiguous cases and uncover a number of cryptic species. Our analysis also reveals the high incidence in animals of semi-isolated species (when some but not all loci are affected by barriers to gene flow) and highlights the intrinsic difficulty, both statistical and conceptual, of delineating species in the grey zone of speciation.},

Model predictions exhibited a significant positive correlation (r = 0.66) with observed relative abundances along a 10 °C gradient in mean annual temperature. The model predicted the correct dominant species in half of the plots, and accurately reproduced species' temperature optimums. The framework is generalizable to any ecosystem as it can accommodate any species pool, any set of functional traits and multiple environmental gradients, and it eliminates some of the criticisms associated with recent trait-based community assembly models.},

abstract = {Understanding how tropical tree species differ in their growth strategies is critical to predict forest dynamics and assess species coexistence. Although tree growth is highly variable in tropical forests, species maximum growth is often considered as a major axis synthesizing species strategies, with fast-growing pioneer and slow-growing shade tolerant species as emblematic representatives. We used a hierarchical linear mixed model and 21-years long tree diameter increment series in a monsoon forest of the Western Ghats, India, to characterize species growth strategies and question whether maximum growth summarizes these strategies. We quantified both species responses to biotic and abiotic factors and individual tree effects unexplained by these factors. Growth responses to competition and tree size appeared highly variable among species which led to reversals in performance ranking along those two gradients. However, species-specific responses largely overlapped due to large unexplained variability resulting mostly from inter-individual growth differences consistent over time. On average one-third of the variability captured by our model was explained by covariates. This emphasizes the high dimensionality of the tree growth process, i.e. the fact that trees differ in many dimensions (genetics, life history) influencing their growth response to environmental gradients, some being unmeasured or unmeasurable. In addition, intraspecific variability increased as a power function of species maximum growth partly as a result of higher absolute responses of fast-growing species to competition and tree size. However, covariates explained on average the same proportion of intraspecific variability for slow- and fast-growing species, which showed the same range of relative responses to competition and tree size. These results reflect a scale invariance of the growth process, underlining that slow- and fast-growing species exhibit the same range of growth strategies.},

abstract = {We investigated how water transport capacity, wood density and wood anatomy were related to leaf photosynthetic traits in two lowland forests in Panama. Leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity ( k(L)) of upper branches was positively correlated with maximum rates of net CO(2) assimilation per unit leaf area ( A(area)) and stomatal conductance ( g(s)) across 20 species of canopy trees. Maximum k(L) showed stronger correlation with A(area) than initial k(L) suggesting that allocation to photosynthetic potential is proportional to maximum water transport capacity. Terminal branch k(L) was negatively correlated with A(area)/ g(s) and positively correlated with photosynthesis per unit N, indicating a trade-off of efficient use of water against efficient use of N in photosynthesis as water transport efficiency varied. Specific hydraulic conductivity calculated from xylem anatomical characteristics ( k(theoretical)) was positively related to A(area) and k(L), consistent with relationships among physiological measurements. Branch wood density was negatively correlated with wood water storage at saturation, k(L), A(area), net CO(2) assimilation per unit leaf mass ( A(mass)), and minimum leaf water potential measured on covered leaves, suggesting that wood density constrains physiological function to specific operating ranges. Kinetic and static indices of branch water transport capacity thus exhibit considerable co-ordination with allocation to potential carbon gain. Our results indicate that understanding tree hydraulic architecture provides added insights to comparisons of leaf level measurements among species, and links photosynthetic allocation patterns with branch hydraulic processes.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. SUMMARY The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. There-fore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Although speciation under sympatric conditions seems theoretically possible, empirical studies are scarce and only a few credible examples of sympatric speciation exist. Here we present a convincing case of sympatric speciation in the Midas cichlid species complex (Amphilophus sp.) in a young and small volcanic crater lake in Nicaragua. Our study includes phylogeographic, population-genetic (based on mitochondrial DNA, microsatellites and amplified fragment length polymorphisms), morphometric and ecological analyses. We find, first, that crater Lake Apoyo was seeded only once by the ancestral high-bodied benthic species Amphilophus citrinellus, the most common cichlid species in the area; second, that a new elongated limnetic species (Amphilophus zaliosus) evolved in Lake Apoyo from the ancestral species (A. citrinellus) within less than approximately 10,000 yr; third, that the two species in Lake Apoyo are reproductively isolated; and fourth, that the two species are eco-morphologically distinct.},

abstract = {Abstract Sympatric speciation is a contentious concept, although theoretical models as well as empirical evidence support its relevance in evolutionary biology. The Midas cichlid species complex (Amphilophus citrinellus, labiatus, zaliosus) from several crater lakes in Nicaragua fits several of the key characteristics of a sympatric speciation model. In particular, in A. citrinellus (i) strong assortative mating on the basis of colour polymorphism and (ii) ecological differentiation based on morphological polymorphisms involving the feeding apparatus and body shape might both be mechanisms of incipient speciation. Seven microsatellite markers and mtDNA control region sequences [836 base pairs (bp)] were used to study the population genetic structure of 519 specimens of Midas cichlid populations from the two Great Lakes Managua and Nicaragua, and three crater lakes in Nicaragua, Central America. The three named species of the species complex occupy different ecological niches, are morphologically distinct and can be distinguished genetically. We uncovered allopatric genetic differentiation of populations of A. citrinellus from different lakes and distant locations within Lake Managua and, more interestingly, incipient genetic differentiation of several sympatric populations based on colouration (in A. citrinellus and A. labiatus) but not on the morphology of the pharyngeal jaws (in A. citrinellus). Sexual selection and assortative mating might be the driven forces of diversification within named species. The Midas cichlid species complex in Nicaragua is an excellent model system for the study of the incipient stages of adaptation, speciation and the formation of species flocks.},

A plant species may be termed persistent if its population does$\backslash$nnot become extinct during a given time period in a given area, or,$\backslash$nif it does, it recolonizes the area within the time span required$\backslash$nfor one turnover of its population. Plant communities in which all$\backslash$nthe common plant species are persistent may be judged to be in compositional$\backslash$nequilibrium.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n2. A critical consideration in the assessment of compositional equilibrium$\backslash$nis the spatial scale at which it is investigated. In a vegetation$\backslash$nmosaic consisting of small patches of different species composition,$\backslash$nindividual patches are often not in compositional equilibrium, even$\backslash$nthough equilibrium may exist at the spatial scale of the entire mosaic.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n3. The patch dynamics perspective emphasizes the importance of periodic$\backslash$ndisturbance in creating opportunities for establishment of new individuals$\backslash$nor growth of previously suppressed individuals by releasing the resources$\backslash$nutilized by the former dominants of the site. Investigation at a$\backslash$nwide range of spatial scales of the temporal and spatial characteristics$\backslash$nof disturbances and plant population responses to disturbances is$\backslash$nessential to an understanding of the regeneration dynamics and$\backslash$n$\backslash$nvegetation patterns in any landscape.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n4. Recognition of compositional equilibrium in contrast to successional$\backslash$ntrends is methodologically difficult for long-lived organisms such$\backslash$nas trees. The surest method, but also the least practical , requiresrepeated$\backslash$ncensuses over multi-year periods. Faster but less certain methods$\backslash$ninclude stand structural analysis and computation of transition probabilities.$\backslash$nBoth methods must be applied with great caution due to the unlikelihood$\backslash$nof obtaining all the data required (e.g. many trees cannot be precisely$\backslash$naged) and the difficulty, without long-term studies, of verifying$\backslash$nassumptions underlying these techniques.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n5. In forest stands at or near compositional equilibrium, species$\backslash$npersistence often involves a combination of resource partitioning$\backslash$nand nonequilibrium mechanisms of coexistence. For many tree species,$\backslash$ndifferences in resource needs and mode of acquiring resources may$\backslash$nbe manifested only during the early stages in their life histories,$\backslash$nas emphasized by the regeneration niche concept. Fine-scale disturbance$\backslash$nin the form of treefalls, however, also favours coexistence by truncating$\backslash$n$\backslash$nprocesses of competitive exclusion and by contributing to the spatial$\backslash$nand temporal heterogeneity of resource availability.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n6. The regeneration niches of tree species may be differentiated in$\backslash$nrelation to the heterogeneity of resource availability associated$\backslash$nwith: (1) gap size, shape and orientation; (2) seasonality and periodicity$\backslash$nof gap creation; (3) the micro-environmental influences of the canopy$\backslash$ntree which previously occupied the gap; ( 4) the nature of substrates$\backslash$nwithin gaps; (5) abundance and composition of gap-occupying understorey$\backslash$nplants; or (6) presence of animals and micro-organisms within gaps.$\backslash$nWhile differences in regeneration niches are often critical to the$\backslash$ncoexistence of tree species, differences among mature trees in their$\backslash$ninfluences on microsites and in their mortality patterns also contribute$\backslash$nsignificantly to their coexistence.},

abstract = {An important decision in presence-only species distribution modeling is how to select background (or pseudo-absence) localities for model parameterization. The selection of such localities may influence model parameterization and thus, can influence the appropriateness and accuracy of the model prediction when extrapolating the species distribution across time and space. We used 12 species from the Australian Wet Tropics (AWT) to evaluate the relationship between the geographic extent from which pseudo-absences are taken and model performance, and shape and importance of predictor variables using the MAXENT modeling method. Model performance is lower when pseudo-absence points are taken from either a restricted or broad region with respect to species occurrence data than from an intermediate region. Furthermore, variable importance (i.e., contribution to the model) changed such that, models became increasingly simplified, dominated by just two variables, as the area from which pseudo-absence points were drawn increased. Our results suggest that it is important to consider the spatial extent from which pseudo-absence data are taken. We suggest species distribution modeling exercises should begin with exploratory analyses evaluating what extent might provide both the most accurate results and biologically meaningful fit between species occurrence and predictor variables. This is especially important when modeling across space or time—a growing application for species distributional modeling.},

Those positive diversity effects resulted mostly from selection effects, primarily driven by fast-growing deciduous species and associated traits.

abstract = {1. A fundamental trade-off among vascular plants between traits inferring rapid resource acquisition and those leading to conservation of resources has now been accepted broadly, but is based on empirical data with a strong bias towards leaf traits. Here, we test whether interspecific variation in traits of different plant organs obeys this same trade-off and whether within-plant trade-offs are consistent between organs. 2. Thereto, we measured suites of the same chemical and structural traits from the main vegetative organs for a species set representing aquatic, riparian and terrestrial environments including the main vascular higher taxa and growth forms of a subarctic flora. The traits were chosen to have consistent relevance for plant defence and growth across organs and environments: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, lignin, dry matter content, pH. 3. Our analysis shows several new trait correlations across leaves, stems and roots and a striking pattern of whole-plant integrative resource economy, leading to tight correspondence between the local leaf economics spectrum and the root (r = 0.64), stem (r = 0.78) and whole-plant (r = 0.93) economics spectra. 4. Synthesis. Our findings strongly suggest that plant resource economics is consistent across species' organs in a subarctic flora. We provide thus the first evidence for a ‘plant economics spectrum' closely related to the local subarctic ‘leaf economics spectrum'. Extending that concept to other biomes is, however, necessary before any generalization might be made. In a world facing rapid vegetation change, these results nevertheless bear considerable prospects of predicting below-ground plant functions from the above-ground components alone.},

abstract = {It was predicted that relationships of leaf mass per area (LMA) with juvenile shade tolerance will depend on leaf habit, and on whether species are compared at a common age as young seedlings, or at a common size as saplings. A meta-analysis of 47 comparative studies (372 species) was used to test predictions, and the effect of light environment on this relationship. The LMA of evergreens was positively correlated with shade tolerance, irrespective of ontogeny or light environment. The LMA of young seedlings ({\textless}or=1 yr) of deciduous species in low light was also positively correlated with shade tolerance; more weakly so in high light. By contrast, size-specific comparisons of deciduous saplings gave negative correlations of LMA with shade tolerance. Independent contrasts and cross-species analyses yielded broadly similar results. We conclude that ontogeny strongly influences the relationship of LMA with shade tolerance of deciduous trees, but has little impact on that of evergreens. Size-specific comparisons reveal opposing trends in deciduous and evergreen taxa: the negative relationship of LMA with shade tolerance of deciduous species is probably dominated by interspecific differences in palisade thickness, whereas patterns in evergreens are probably shaped more by the degree of structural reinforcement, linked to wide variation in leaf lifespan.},

abstract = {We use the molecular data available for the plant genera currently distributed in the Canaries to propose a hypothetical framework that updates the Surfing Syngameon Hypothesis (SSH) to explain the origins of the high genetic diversity of this flora in connection with the General Dynamic Model of Island Ontogeny and the available knowledge on the geology of the islands. Based on our review, we propose that (i) secondary contact and subsequent gene flow among genotypes previously confined to the mainland or to other insular regions generated syngameons across the archipelago, whose temporal extent and distribution were influenced by the ontogenetic stages of each island; and (ii) the resulting high levels of genetic variation were critical to the successful colonization of many other regions in the Canaries, especially those where more complex geographical and ecological features promoted gene flow cessation, drift, and/or eventual selection processes leading to species radiations. Under the updated SSH, the colonizing contingents of the islands would not necessarily have low genetic variation, because multiple colonizations followed by secondary contact among different genotypes would enhance genetic diversity through introgressive hybridization. As with other theories, the SSH contends that the monophyly detected in a large proportion of its lineages is artifactual. However, the SSH further differs from past hypotheses in (i) suggesting a spatio-temporal sequence of events giving rise to syngameons in different islands and island regions, (ii) showing that the ontogenetic mismatch among the Canarian islands should be largely responsible for similar levels of population genetic diversity in many congeneric endemics distributed in several islands, (iii) hypothesizing a substantial role for both allopolyploid and homoploid hybridization in the origins of the Canarian flora, and (iv) positing that, in many cases, the admixture processes in the syngameons formed at different stages of the islands' ontogeny made possible the rapid colonization of multiple environments, and the generation of the current floristic diversity.},

We refined methods for quantifying the percent loss of rehydration capacity (PLRC), and for 18 Southern California woody species, we determined the relative water content and leaf water potential at PLRC of 10{\%}, 25{\%}, and 50{\%}, and, additionally, the PLRC at important stages of dehydration including stomatal closure and turgor loss. On average, PLRC of 10{\%} occurred below turgor loss point and at similar water status to 80{\%} decline of stomatal conductance. As hypothesized, the sensitivity to loss of leaf rehydration capacity varied across species, leaf habits, and ecosystems and correlated with other drought tolerance traits, including the turgor loss point and structural traits including leaf mass per area. A new database of PLRC for 89 species from the global literature indicated greater leaf rehydration capacity in ecosystems with lower growing season moisture availability, indicating an adaptive role of leaf cell dehydration tolerance within the complex of drought tolerance traits.},

abstract = {The relative turgidity technique consists in comparing the initial and turgid water contents, on a percentage basis, of disks punched from leaves, the turgid water content being obtained by floating the disks on water. Three main sources of error associated with flotation are recognized: (1) changes in dry weight of the disks; (2) continued increase in water content after the attain{\textperiodcentered} ment of full turgidity; (3) injection of the intercellular spaces at the cut edges of the disks. An examination of these sources of error led to the following conclusions concerning them: (1) By regulating the light intensity approximately to the compensation point, dry weight changes can be reduced to unimportant proportions. This obviates the necessity of taking duplicate samples since the final dry weight can be used for calculating both the initial and turgid water content of the disks. (2) Water uptake by floating leaf disks can be divided into two phases, phase I in response to the initial water deficit, and phase II the continued uptake, due to growth. The aim of the technique is to measure phase I alone. Metabolic inhibitors eliminated phase II but their use in the technique is unpractical (anaerobiosis) or objectionable (potassium cyanide). Low temperature (3°C) eliminated phase II but reduced phase I which itself appears to be divisible into more than one phase. It was found that for Ricinus communis L. full turgidity was attained in 4 hr and in this period phase II increase did not occur. A similar period appears to be suitable for a wide range of material. This short flotation time also reduced any danger of dry weight changes. (3) Injection errors were measured and found to be negligible for Ricinus. For Sambucus nigra L. they were considerable. Evidently the magnitude of this error varies with the species concerned. Plastic flow or irreversible contraction of the cell walls of turgid or wilted disks respectively was not found to be of importance.},

abstract = {Premise of the study: Wood density correlates with mechanical and physiological strategies of trees and is important for estimating global carbon stocks. Nonetheless, the relationship between branch and trunk xylem density has been poorly explored in neotropical trees. Here, we examine this relationship in trees from French Guiana and its variation among different families and sites, to improve the understanding of wood density in neotropical forests. Methods: Trunk and branch xylem densities were measured for 1909 trees in seven sites across French Guiana. A major-axisfit was performed to explore their general allometric relationship and its variation among different families and sites. Key results: Trunk xylem and branch xylem densities were significantly positively correlated, and their relationship explained 47{\%} of the total variance. Trunk xylem was on average 9{\%} denser than branch xylem. Family-level differences and interactions between family and site accounted for more than 40{\%} of the total variance, whereas differences among sites explained little variation. Conclusions: Variation in xylem density within individual trees can be substantial, and the relationship between branch xylem and trunk xylem densities varies considerably among families and sites. As such, whole-tree biomass estimates based on nondestructive branch sampling should correct for both taxonomic and environmental factors. Furthermore, detailed estimates of the vertical distribution of wood density within individual trees are needed to determine the extent to which relying solely upon measures of trunk wood density may cause carbon stocks in tropical forests to be overestimated. {\textcopyright} 2011 Botanical Society of America.},

Working in Borneo – at a site where 70-m-tall forests in alluvial valleys rapidly transition to stunted heath forests on nutrient-depleted dip slopes – we combined field data with airborne laser scanning and hyperspectral imaging to characterise how topography shapes the vertical structure, wood density, diversity and ACD of nearly 15 km2 of old-growth forest. We found that subtle differences in elevation – which control soil chemistry and hydrology – profoundly influenced the structure, composition and diversity of the canopy. Capturing these processes was critical to explaining landscape-scale heterogeneity in ACD, highlighting how emerging remote sensing technologies can provide new insights into long-standing ecological questions.},

abstract = {Forest degradation is a global environmental issue, but its definition is problematic. Difficulties include choosing appropriate reference states, timescales, thresholds, and forest values. We dispense with many such ambiguities by interpreting forest degradation through the frame of ecological resilience, and with reference to forest dynamics. Specifically, we define forest degradation as a state of anthropogenically induced arrested succession, where ecological processes that underlie forest dynamics are diminished or severely constrained. Metrics of degradation might include those that reflect ecological processes shaping community dynamics, notably the regeneration of plant species. Arrested succession implies that management intervention is necessary to recover successional trajectories. Such a definition can be applied to any forest ecosystem, and can also be extended to other ecosystems. Forest degradation results in biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions, and diminution of ecosystem goods and services, but scientists, practitioners, and policy-makers are unable to agree a framework for defining degradation. Forests are spatially and temporally dynamic, and this stymies the selection of appropriate reference states, timescales, and thresholds against which degradation might be determined. Degradation is often defined as reduced capacity to provide goods and services. This definition takes little account of forest resilience - the ability of a system to reorganize and recover following disturbance. Advances in describing and quantifying ecosystem functioning have been fundamental in understanding forest dynamics, and provide a promising framework by which degradation might be better understood and, ultimately, defined.},

Here, we characterize worldwide patterns in leaf size. Large-leaved species predominate in wet, hot, sunny environments; small-leaved species typify hot, sunny environments only in arid conditions; small leaves are also found in high latitudes and elevations. By modeling the balance of leaf energy inputs and outputs, we show that daytime and nighttime leaf-to-air temperature differences are key to geographic gradients in leaf size.

Surprisingly, these two suites of traits were statisti- cally decoupled. This decoupling suggests that independent trait dimensions exist within a leaf, with leaf economics dimension corresponding to light capture and tissue longevity, and the hydraulic dimension to water-use and leaf temperature maintenance. Clearly, leaf economics and hydraulic traits can vary independently, thus allowing for more possible plant trait combinations. Compared with a single trait dimension, multiple trait dimensions may better enable species adap- tations to multifarious niche dimensions, promote diverse plant strategies and facilitate species coexistence.},

Three major climatic drivers were identified through the variable selection procedure: drought, water saturation and temperature. Drought decreased annual growth and mortality rates, high precipitation increased mortality rates and high temperature decreased growth. Interactions between key functional traits, stature and climatic variables were investigated, showing best resistance to drought for trees with high wood density and for trees with small current diameters.

These data are used to provide an answer to the following questions: which are the fruit characteristics that lead fruit choice of howler monkeys and to what extent fruit characteristics play a role in seed dispersal by monkeys? The frugivorous diet of a troop of red howler monkeys was determined during a 2-year field study in French Guiana. The selection of fruit by howler monkeys was analyzed in relation to the fruit availability. Results showed that, although consumption followed availability, fruit species could be classified in three categories according to their selection ratio (percentage of consumption/percentage of abundance) as 'high ranking,' 'middle ranking,' and 'low ranking' species. Also, the 97 species of fruit eaten by the monkeys were grouped according to the morphological characteristics thought to influence the monkeys' choice. This showed that howler monkeys consumed essentially fruits with juicy pulp, bright color, and a small number of well-protected seeds. Most of high ranking species had medium-sized fruits with yellow color, and low ranking species often had small fruits. However, howler monkeys are associated with the dispersal of seeds from fruit with a hard and indehiscent pericarp and/or large seeds, like those of the Sapotaceae family. Consequently, they can be considered as 'specialized' frugivores for this fruit syndrome.},

abstract = {The lack of information on the ways seasonal drought modifies the CO2 exchange between Neotropical rainforest ecosystems and the atmosphere and the resulting carbon balance hinders our ability to precisely predict how these ecosystems will respond as global environmental changes force them to face increasingly contrasting conditions in the future. To address this issue, seasonal variations in daily net ecosystem productivity (NEPd) and two main components of this productivity, daily total ecosystem respiration (REd) and daily gross ecosystem productivity (GEPd), were estimated over 2 years at a flux tower site in French Guiana, South America (5°16′54″N, 52°54′44″W). We compared seasonal variations between wet and dry periods and between dry periods of contrasting levels of intensity (i.e. mild vs. severe) during equivalent 93-day periods. During the wet periods, the ecosystem was almost in balance with the atmosphere (storage of 9.0 g Cm-2). Seasonal dry periods, regardless of their severity, are associated with higher incident radiation and lower REd combined with reduced soil respiration associated with low soil water availability. During the mild dry period, as is normally the case in this region, the amount of carbon stored in the ecosystem was 32.7 g Cm-2. Severe drought conditions resulted in even lower REd, whereas the photosynthetic activity was only moderately reduced and no change in canopy structure was observed. Thus, the severe dry period was characterized by greater carbon storage (64.6 g C m-2), emphasizing that environmental conditions, such as during a severe drought, modify the CO2 exchange between Neotropical rainforest ecosystems and the atmosphere and potentially the resulting carbon balance. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing.},

abstract = {Human activity is causing wild populations to experience rapid trait change and local extirpation. The resulting effects on intraspecific variation could have substantial consequences for ecological processes and ecosystem services. Although researchers have long acknowledged that variation among species influences the surrounding environment, only recently has evidence accumulated for the ecological importance of variation within species. We conducted a meta-analysis comparing the ecological effects of variation within a species (intraspecific effects) with the effects of replacement or removal of that species (species effects). We evaluated direct and indirect ecological responses, including changes in abundance (or biomass), rates of ecological processes and changes in community composition. Our results show that intraspecific effects are often comparable to, and sometimes stronger than, species effects. Species effects tend to be larger for direct ecological responses (for example, through consumption), whereas intraspecific effects and species effects tend to be similar for indirect responses (for example, through trophic cascades). Intraspecific effects are especially strong when indirect interactions alter community composition. Our results summarize data from the first generation of studies examining the relative ecological effects of intraspecific variation. Our conclusions can help inform the design of future experiments and the formulation of strategies to quantify and conserve biodiversity.},

abstract = {Plant traits—the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants—determine how plants respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, and influence ecosystem properties and their benefits and detriments to people. Plant trait data thus represent the basis for a vast area of research spanning from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology, to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem and landscape management, restoration, biogeography and earth system modelling. Since its foundation in 2007, the TRY database of plant traits has grown continuously. It now provides unprecedented data coverage under an open access data policy and is the main plant trait database used by the research community worldwide. Increasingly, the TRY database also supports new frontiers of trait-based plant research, including the identification of data gaps and the subsequent mobilization or measurement of new data. To support this development, in this article we evaluate the extent of the trait data compiled in TRY and analyse emerging patterns of data coverage and representativeness. Best species coverage is achieved for categorical traits—almost complete coverage for ‘plant growth form'. However, most traits relevant for ecology and vegetation modelling are characterized by continuous intraspecific variation and trait–environmental relationships. These traits have to be measured on individual plants in their respective environment. Despite unprecedented data coverage, we observe a humbling lack of completeness and representativeness of these continuous traits in many aspects. We, therefore, conclude that reducing data gaps and biases in the TRY database remains a key challenge and requires a coordinated approach to data mobilization and trait measurements. This can only be achieved in collaboration with other initiatives.},

abstract = {Understanding the ecological consequences of biodiversity is a fundamental challenge. Research on a key component of biodiversity, genetic diversity, has traditionally focused on its importance in evolutionary processes, but classical studies in evolutionary biology, agronomy and conservation biology indicate that genetic diversity might also have important ecological effects. Our review of the literature reveals significant effects of genetic diversity on ecological processes such as primary productivity, population recovery from disturbance, interspecific competition, community structure, and fluxes of energy and nutrients. Thus, genetic diversity can have important ecological consequences at the population, community and ecosystem levels, and in some cases the effects are comparable in magnitude to the effects of species diversity. However, it is not clear how widely these results apply in nature, as studies to date have been biased towards manipulations of plant clonal diversity, and little is known about the relative importance of genetic diversity vs. other factors that influence ecological processes of interest. Future studies should focus not only on documenting the presence of genetic diversity effects but also on identifying underlying mechanisms and predicting when such effects are likely to occur in nature.},

abstract = {How large numbers of competing plant species manage to coexist is a major unresolved question in community ecology. The classical explanation, that each species occupies its own niche, seems at first unlikely because most plants require the same set of resources and acquire these in a limited number of ways. However, recent studies, although few in number and incomplete in many ways, do suggest that plants segregate along various environmental niche axes, including gradients of light, soil moisture and root depth, and that partitioning of soil nutrients occurs, possibly through the mediation of microbial symbionts, some of which are more species specific than was previously thought. Although it is unlikely that niche separation along environmental axes is the only mechanism of coexistence in any large community, the evidence now suggests that it plays a more significant role than has been previously appreciated. More research into the consequences of various known tradeoffs is likely to uncover further cases of niche separation facilitating coexistence.},

Janzen−Connell effects, in which host-specific natural enemies restrict the recruitment of juveniles near conspecific adults, provide a potential mechanism. Janzen−Connell is strongly supported empirically, but existing theory does not address the stable coexistence of hundreds of species. Here we use high-performance computing and analytical models to demonstrate that tropical forest diversity can be maintained nearly indefinitely in a prolonged state of transient dynamics due to distance-responsive natural enemies. Further, we show that Janzen−Connell effects lead to community regulation of diversity by imposing a diversity-dependent cost to commonness and benefit to rarity. The resulting species−area and rank−abundance relationships are consistent with empirical results. Diversity maintenance over long time spans does not require dispersal from an external metacommunity, speciation, or resource niche partitioning, only a small zone around conspecific adults in which saplings fail to recruit. We conclude that the Janzen−Connell mechanism can explain the maintenance of tropical tree diversity while not precluding the operation of other niche-based mechanisms such as resource partitioning.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The importance of intraspecific variation in plant functional traits for structuring communities and driving ecosystem processes is increasingly recognized, but mechanisms governing this variation are less studied. Variation could be due to adaptation to local conditions, plasticity in observed traits, or ontogeny. We investigated 1) whether abiotic stress caused individuals, maternal lines, and populations to exhibit trait convergence, 2) whether trait variation was primarily due to ecotypic differences or trait plasticity, and 3) whether traits varied with ontogeny. We sampled three populations of Hypochaeris radicata that differed significantly in rosette diameter and specific leaf area (SLA). We grew nine maternal lines from each population (27 lines total) under three greenhouse conditions: ambient conditions (control), 50{\%} drought, or 80{\%} shade. Plant diameter and relative chlorophyll content were measured throughout the experiment, and leaf shape, root:shoot ratio, and SLA were measured after five weeks. We used hierarchical mixed-models and variance component analysis to quantify differences in treatment effects and the contributions of population of origin and maternal line to observed variation. Observed variation in plant traits was driven primarily by plasticity. Shade significantly influenced all measured traits. Plant diameter was the only trait that had a sizable proportion of trait variation (30{\%}) explained by population of origin. There were significant ontogenetic differences for both plant diameter and relative chlorophyll content. When subjected to abiotic stress in the form of light or water limitation, Hypochaeris radicata exhibited significant trait variability. This variation was due primarily to trait plasticity, rather than to adaptation to local conditions, and also differed with ontogeny.},

abstract = {1.A small number of species-rich plant genera make a substantial contribution to the $\alpha$ diversity of tropical forests. These 'species swarms' (Gentry 1982) challenge a view of community assembly that maintains that niche overlap, and hence, the likelihood of competitive exclusion should increase with phylogenetic affinity. Related species may, however, occupy different microhabitats within a forest stand or, alternatively, differ ecologically in ways that allow them to coexist syntopically. 2.To explore the relationship between phylogenetic history and niche differentiation among sympatric, congeneric species, we performed phylogenetic analyses of microhabitat preferences, photosynthetic and hydraulic traits, and experimental responses to light and water availability for 20 species of Psychotria (Rubiaceae) from Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. 3.The Psychotria present in small (3-m radius), circular plots were more closely related than expected by chance. Photosynthetic and hydraulic traits were both associated with species habitat distributions, but only hydraulic traits were conserved phylogenetically. Experimental responses to water availability were also conserved phylogenetically. Functional trait analyses revealed little or no evidence of niche partitioning within sites. 4.We conclude that Psychotria species' responses to both light and moisture availability determine their microhabitat distributions on BCI and that evolutionarily conserved hydraulic traits lead to phylogenetic clustering of co-occurring species. 5.Synthesis.The evolutionary conservation of hydraulic traits related to soil moisture tolerance largely explains phylogenetic clustering in the local assembly of the hyperdiverse genus Psychotria. We suggest that close relatives are unlikely to exclude one another from shared habitats because resource availability is determined largely by asymmetric competition with the overstorey, rather than by competition with neighbouring understorey plants. In light of the recent biogeographic admixture in central Panama, the phylogenetic niche conservatism exhibited by Psychotria on BCI raises the possibility of an association between local microhabitats and the ancestral climatic regimes under which major Psychotria lineages evolved before arriving in sympatry. Our results suggest that the 20 species of Psychotria treelets found on Barro Colorado Island, Panama occur in phylogenetically clustered assemblages as a result of environmental filtering of evolutionarily conserved hydraulic traits. We suggest that close relatives are unlikely to exclude one another from shared habitats because resource availability is determined largely by asymmetric competition with the overstorey. {\textcopyright} 2012 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that selection can allow coexistence in situations where ecological dynamics lead to competitive exclusion, provided that there is a trade-off between traits optimal for interacting with conspecifics and traits optimal for interacting with heterospecifics. Despite compelling empirical evidence, there is no general framework for elucidating how and when selection will allow coexistence in natural communities. Here we develop such a framework for a mechanism that we term "neighbor-dependent selection." We show that this mechanism can both augment coexistence when ecological conditions allow for niche partitioning and enable coexistence when ecological conditions lead to competitive exclusion. The novel insight is that when ecological conditions lead to exclusion, neighbor-dependent selection can allow coexistence via cycles driven by an intransitive loop; selection causes one species to be a superior interspecific competitor when it is rare and an inferior interspecific competitor when it is abundant. Our framework predicts the conditions under which selection can enable coexistence, as opposed to merely augmenting it, and elucidates the effects of heritability on the eco-evolutionary feedbacks that drive coexistence. Given increasing evidence that evolution operates on ecological timescales, our approach provides one means for evaluating the role of selection and trait evolution in species coexistence. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The University of Chicago.},

Several experiments have provided evidence that reduced species diversity may impair ecosystem processes such as plant biomass production. The interpretation of these experiments, however, has been controversial because two types of mechanism may operate in combination. In the 'selection effect', dominance by species with particular traits affects ecosystem processes. In the 'complementarity effect', resource partitioning or positive interactions lead to increased total resource use. Here we present a new approach to separate the two effects on the basis of an additive partitioning analogous to the Price equation in evolutionary genetics. Applying this method to data from the pan-European BIODEPTH experiment reveals that the selection effect is zero on average and varies from negative to positive in different localities, depending on whether species with lower- or higher-than-average biomass dominate communities. In contrast, the complementarity effect is positive overall, supporting the hypothesis that plant diversity influences primary production in European grasslands through niche differentiation or facilitation.},

abstract = {Multiple-trait association mapping, in which multiple traits are used simultaneously in the identification of genetic variants affecting those traits, has recently attracted interest. One class of approaches for this problem builds on classical variance component methodology, utilizing a multitrait version of a linear mixed model. These approaches both increase power and provide insights into the genetic architecture of multiple traits. In particular, it is possible to estimate the genetic correlation, which is a measure of the portion of the total correlation between traits that is due to additive genetic effects. Unfortunately, the practical utility of these methods is limited since they are computationally intractable for large sample sizes. In this article, we introduce a reformulation of the multiple-trait association mapping approach by defining the matrix-variate linear mixed model. Our approach reduces the computational time necessary to perform maximum-likelihood inference in a multiple-trait model by utilizing a data transformation. By utilizing a well-studied human cohort, we show that our approach provides more than a 10-fold speedup, making multiple-trait association feasible in a large population cohort on the genome-wide scale. We take advantage of the efficiency of our approach to analyze gene expression data. By decomposing gene coexpression into a genetic and environmental component, we show that our method provides fundamental insights into the nature of coexpressed genes. An implementation of this method is available at http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/mvLMM.},

The unusual rate and extent of anthropogenic alterations of the environment may exceed the capacity of developmental, genetic, and demographic mechanisms that populations have evolved to deal with environmental change. To begin to understand the limits to population persistence, we present a simple evolutionary model for the critical rate of environmental change beyond which a population must decline and go extinct. We use this model to highlight the major determinants of extinction risk in a changing environment, and identify research needs for improved predictions based on projected changes in environmental variables. Two key parameters relating the environment to population biology have not yet received sufficient attention. Phenotypic plasticity, the direct influence of environment on the development of individual phenotypes, is increasingly considered an important component of phenotypic change in the wild and should be incorporated in models of population persistence. Environmental sensitivity of selection, the change in the optimum phenotype with the environment, still crucially needs empirical assessment. We use environmental tolerance curves and other examples of ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change to illustrate how these mechanistic approaches can be developed for predictive purposes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Chevin et al.},

abstract = {* Functional traits can be used to describe the composition of communities through indices that seek to explain the factors that drive community assembly, biotic effects on ecosystem processes or both. Appropriately representing functional composition is therefore essential for predicting the consequences of environmental context and management actions for the provisioning of multiple ecosystem services (ESs) in heterogeneous landscapes. * Functional indices can be constructed from single or multiple traits; however, it is not clear how they differ in information content or ability to predict biodiversity – ecosystem function relationships in complex landscapes. Here, we compare the utility of analogous single- and multi-trait indices in linking environmental variation and functional composition to ESs in a heterogeneous landscape, relating functional indices based on three plant traits [height, relative growth rate and root density (RD)] to variation in the physical environment and to two ESs (forage production and soil carbon) and their net ES level. * Two orthogonal gradients, elevation and soil bulk density (BD), explained significant variation in several dimensions of functional composition comprised of single traits. These traits in turn significantly predicted variation in ESs and their net values. Only one index measured with multiple traits (functional richness) varied with the physical environment, while none predicted variation in ES or net ES levels. * One ES, soil carbon, increased with the community-average value of RD, while the other, forage production, was related to the range and community-average value of height. In turn, average RD increased with soil BD while the average and range of height declined with elevation. Due to these environmental patterns, soil carbon and forage production did not covary strongly, leading to moderate net ES levels across the landscape. * Synthesis: Single-trait indices of functional composition best linked variation in environmental gradients with productivity and soil carbon. Because the environment–trait functioning relationships were independent of one another, the ESs were independently distributed across the landscape, providing little evidence of synergies or trade-offs. Single- and multi-trait indices contained unique information about functional composition of these communities, and both are likely to have a place in predicting variation in ESs under different scenarios.},

@article{Herold2011,
abstract = {Measuring forest degradation and related forest carbon stock changes is more challenging than measuring deforestation since degradation implies changes in the structure of the forest and does not entail a change in land use, making it less easily detectable through remote sensing. Although we anticipate the use of the IPCC guidance under the United Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), there is no one single method for monitoring forest degradation for the case of REDD+ policy. In this review paper we highlight that the choice depends upon a number of factors including the type of degradation, available historical data, capacities and resources, and the potentials and limitations of various measurement and monitoring approaches. Current degradation rates can be measured through field data (i.e. multi-date national forest inventories and permanent sample plot data, commercial forestry data sets, proxy data from domestic markets) and/or remote sensing data (i.e. direct mapping of canopy and forest structural changes or indirect mapping through modelling approaches), with the combination of techniques providing the best options. Developing countries frequently lack consistent historical field data for assessing past forest degradation, and so must rely more on remote sensing approaches mixed with current field assessments of carbon stock changes. Historical degradation estimates will have larger uncertainties as it will be difficult to determine their accuracy. However improving monitoring capacities for systematic forest degradation estimates today will help reduce uncertainties even for historical estimates.},

@article{Pitman2001,
abstract = {Amazonian forests are the largest and most diverse in the tropics, and much of the mystery surrounding their ecology can be traced to attempts to understand them through tiny local inventories. In this paper we bring together a large number of such inventories scattered across immense areas of western Amazonia in order to address simple questions about the distribution and abundance of tropical tree species in lowland terra firme forests there. The goal is to describe patterns of commonness and rarity at local (1 ha), landscape (∼ 104 km2), and regional ({\textgreater} 106 km2) scales, and to fuse the results into a more complete picture of how tropical tree communities are structured. We present estimates of landscape-scale densities for ∼ 1400 taxa, based on data from tree plots scattered over large tracts of terra firme forest in eastern Ecuador and southeastern Peru. A database of morphological, ecological, and other traits of {\textgreater} 1000 of these species compiled from the taxonomic literature is then used to explore how species that are common in the inventories differ from species that are rare. Although most species show landscape-scale densities of {\textless} 1 individual/ha, most trees in both forests belong to a small set of ubiquitous common species. These common species combine high frequency with high local abundance, forming predictable oligarchies that dominate several thousand square kilometers of forest at each site. The common species comprising these oligarchies are a nonrandom subset of the two floras. At both sites a disproportionate number of common species are concentrated in the families Arecaceae, Moraceae, Myristicaceae, and Violaceae, and large-statured tree species are more likely to be common than small ones. Nearly a third of the 150 most common tree species in the Ecuadorean forest are also found among the 150 most common tree species in the Peruvian forest. For the 254 tree species shared by the two data sets, abundance in Ecuador is positively and significantly correlated with abundance ∼ 1400 km away in Peru. These findings challenge popular depictions of Amazonian vegetation as a small-scale mosaic of unpredictable composition and structure. Instead, they provide additional evidence that tropical tree communities are not qualitatively different from their temperate counterparts, where a few common species concentrated in a few higher taxa can dominate immense areas of forest. We hypothesize that most Amazonian forests are dominated at large scales by oligarchies similar in nature to the ones observed in Ecuador and Peru, and we argue that the patterns are more indicative of regulation of relative abundances by ecological factors than of nonequilibrium chance-based dynamics. The paper concludes with a discussion of the practical applications of predictable oligarchies over large areas of unexplored forest.},

abstract = {The world's greatest terrestrial stores of biodiversity and carbon are found in the forests of northern South America, where large-scale biogeographic patterns and processes have recently begun to be described. Seven of the nine countries with territory in the Amazon basin and the Guiana shield have carried out large-scale forest inventories, but such massive data sets have been little exploited by tropical plant ecologists. Although forest inventories often lack the species-level identifications favoured by tropical plant ecologists, their consistency of measurement and vast spatial coverage make them ideally suited for numerical analyses at large scales, and a valuable resource to describe the still poorly understood spatial variation of biomass, diversity, community composition and forest functioning across the South American tropics. Here we show, by using the seven forest inventories complemented with trait and inventory data collected elsewhere, two dominant gradients in tree composition and function across the Amazon, one paralleling a major gradient in soil fertility and the other paralleling a gradient in dry season length. The data set also indicates that the dominance of Fabaceae in the Guiana shield is not necessarily the result of root adaptations to poor soils (nodulation or ectomycorrhizal associations) but perhaps also the result of their remarkably high seed mass there as a potential adaptation to low rates of disturbance.},

@article{Ibanez2019,
abstract = {Plants as sessile organisms are exposed to persistently changing stress factors. The primary stresses such as drought, salinity, cold and hot temperatures and chemicals are interconnected in their effects on plants. These factors cause damage to the plant cell and lead to secondary stresses such as osmotic and oxidative stresses. Plants cannot avoid the exposure to these factors but adapt morphologically and physiologically by some other mechanisms. Almost all stresses induce the production of a group of proteins called heat-shock proteins (Hsps) or stress-induced proteins. The induction of transcription of these proteins is a common phenomenon in all living things. These proteins are grouped in plants into five classes according to their approximate molecular weight: (1) Hsp100, (2) Hsp90, (3) Hsp70, (4) Hsp60 and (5) small heat-shock proteins (sHsps). Higher plants have at least 20 sHsps and there might be 40 kinds of these sHsps in one plant species. It is believed that this diversification of these proteins reflects an adaptation to tolerate the heat stress. Transcription of heat-shock protein genes is controlled by regulatory proteins called heat stress transcription factors (Hsfs). Plants show at least 21 Hsfs with each one having its role in regulation, but they also cooperate in all phases of periodical heat stress responses (triggering, maintenance and recovery). There are more than 52 plant species (including crop ones) that have been genetically engineered for different traits such as yield, herbicide and insecticide resistance and some metabolic changes.In conclusion, major heat-shock proteins have some kind of related roles in solving the problem of misfolding and aggregation, as well as their role as chaperones. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {Field experiments were conducted during two rainy seasons to study the effect of soil moisture deficit on total biomass, pod yield, harvest index (HI) and drought tolerance index (DTI) in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) cultivars possessing a wide range of specific leaf area (SLA, 144-241 cm2 g-1). There were three soil moisture regimes: adequate irrigation (W1), drought simulated under rain-out-shelter (W2) and rain-fed (W3). This experiment had two parts, in one, five cultivars were exposed to W1, W2 and W3, and in a second, seven cultivars were exposed to W1 and W3. Using the same set of seven cultivars, pot-culture experiments were conducted to study relative water content (RWC), stomatal conductance (gs) and single leaf carbon exchange rate (CER) during increasing moisture-deficit in two contrasting (rainy and summer) seasons. Variation in DTI was significant, and low SLA types had greater DTI under both W2 and W3. The ranking of SLA among cultivars was consistent between experiments conducted during the two seasons. The rate of reduction in leaf RWC during the progressive moisture-deficit was related directly to SLA (r = 0.78, P {\textless} 0.01). The coefficient of determination of the slopes calculated between RWC and soil moisture during the experimental period was more in the summer (r2 = 0.82) than the rainy (r2 = 0.54) season. Under increasing moisture-deficit, the low SLA types were able to maintain higher RWC, CER and gs in both seasons. The relationships between RWC and CER (r = 0.91, P {\textless} 0.01), and RWC and gs (r = 0.65, P {\textless} 0.01) were significant. It is suggested that under water-limited conditions there is a significant inverse relationship between SLA and RWC. The low SLA types (water use efficient) were found to be drought tolerant in terms of total dry matter production in the field studies, and maintenance of higher RWC under drought like situations in pot-culture experiments. Thus the ability of the low SLA types (higher water use efficiency, WUE) to maintain higher RWC may form the basis for the differences in drought tolerance vis a vis WUE in groundnut cultivars differing in SLA. Suggestions are made to select parents for drought tolerance or WUE, and to initiate breeding to combine traits like high HI, and WUE in terms of lower SLA. Ultimately, selection for both WUE (measured in terms of SLA) and yield traits (HI) should result in cultivars with improved performance in rain-fed agriculture. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Environmental changes are expected to shift the distribution of functional trait values in plant communities through a combination of species turnover and intraspecific variation. The strength of these shifts may depend on the availability of individuals with trait values adapted to new environmental conditions, represented by the functional diversity (FD) of existing community residents or dispersal from the regional species pool. We conducted a 3-year nutrient- and seed-addition experiment in old-field plant communities to examine the contributions of species turnover and intraspecific variation to community trait shifts, focusing on four key plant functional traits: vegetative height, leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). We further examined the influence of initial FD and seed availability on the strength of these shifts. Community mean height, leaf area, and SLA increased in response to fertilization, and these shifts were driven almost entirely by intraspecific variation. The strength of intraspecific shifts in height and leaf area was positively related to initial intraspecific FD in these traits. Intraspecific trait responses to fertilization varied among species, with species of short stature displaying stronger shifts in SLA and LDMC but weaker shifts in leaf area. Trait shifts due to species turnover were generally weak and opposed intraspecific responses. Seed addition altered community taxonomic composition but had little effect on community trait shifts. These results highlight the importance of intraspecific variation for short-term community functional responses and demonstrate that the strength of these responses may be mediated by community FD.},

abstract = {Biodiversity is rapidly declining worldwide, and there is consensus that this can decrease ecosystem functioning and services. It remains unclear, though, whether few or many of the species in an ecosystem are needed to sustain the provisioning of ecosystem services. It has been hypothesized that most species would promote ecosystem services if many times, places, functions and environmental changes were considered; however, no previous study has considered all of these factors together. Here we show that 84{\%} of the 147 grassland plant species studied in 17 biodiversity experiments promoted ecosystem functioning at least once. Different species promoted ecosystem functioning during different years, at different places, for different functions and under different environmental change scenarios. Furthermore, the species needed to provide one function during multiple years were not the same as those needed to provide multiple functions within one year. Our results indicate that even more species will be needed to maintain ecosystem functioning and services than previously suggested by studies that have either (1) considered only the number of species needed to promote one function under one set of environmental conditions, or (2) separately considered the importance of biodiversity for providing ecosystem functioning across multiple years, places, functions or environmental change scenarios. Therefore, although species may appear functionally redundant when one function is considered under one set of environmental conditions, many species are needed to maintain multiple functions at multiple times and places in a changing world.},

The “ssdm” package is a computer platform implemented in R providing a range of methodological approaches and parameterisation at each step in building the SSDM: e.g. pseudo-absence selection, variable contribution and model accuracy assessment, inter-model consensus forecasting, species assembly design, and cal- culation of weighted endemism. 3. The object-oriented design of the package is such that: users can modify existing methods, extend the framework by implementing new methods, and share them to be reproduced by others. 4. The package includes a graphical user interface to extend the use of SSDMs to a wide range of conservation scientists and practitioners},

abstract = {Adaptation to winter cold in temperate and boreal trees involves complex genetic, physiological, and devel- opmental processes. Genecological studies demonstrate the existence of steep genetic clines for cold adaptation traits in relation to environmental (mostly temperature related) gradients. Population differentiation is generally stronger for cold adaptation traits than for other quantitative traits and allozymes. Therefore, these traits appear to be under strong natu- ral selection. Nonetheless, high levels of genetic variation persist within populations. The genetic control of cold adap- tation traits ranges from weak to strong, with phenological traits having the highest heritabilities. Within-population genetic correlations among traits range from negligible to moderate. Generally, bud phenology and cold hardiness in the fall are genetically uncorrelated with bud phenology and cold hardiness in the spring. Analyses of quantitative trait loci indicate that cold adaptation traits are mostly controlled by multiple genes with small effects and that quantitative trait loci × environment interactions are common. Given this inherent complexity, we suggest that future research should focus on identifying and developing markers for cold adaptation candidate genes, then using multilocus, multi- allelic analytical techniques to uncover the relationships between genotype and phenotype at both the individual and population levels. Ultimately, these methods may be useful for predicting the performance of genotypes in breeding programs and for better understanding the evolutionary ecology of forest trees. Key},

abstract = {Correlations between community-weighted mean (CWM) traits and environmental gradients are often assumed to quantify the adaptive value of traits. We tested this assumption by comparing these correlations with models of survival probability using 46 perennial species from long-term permanent plots in pine forests of Arizona. Survival was modelled as a function of trait × environment interactions, plant size, climatic variation and neighbourhood competition. The effect of traits on survival depended on the environmental conditions, but the two statistical approaches were inconsistent. For example, CWM-specific leaf area (SLA) and soil fertility were uncorrelated. However, survival was highest for species with low SLA in infertile soil, a result which agreed with expectations derived from the physiological trade-off underpinning leaf economic theory. CWM trait–environment relationships were unreliable estimates of how traits affected survival, and should only be used in predictive models when there is empirical support for an evolutionary trade-off that affects vital rates.},

abstract = {Local adaptation reflects the fact that local populations tend to have a higher mean fitness in their native environment than in other environments and in other populations introduced in their home site. Starting in the 1920s a large number of reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments, as well as studies of populations along environmental clines, have demonstrated that local adaptation is widespread in plants. One remaining challenge is to understand how populations become locally adapted and to characterise the genes involved in this process. Theoretically, local selection at single loci will promote local adaptation and gene flow will decrease it. For quantitative traits, the situation is more complex, and strong local adaptation can even be established and maintained in the presence of higher gene flow. The genetic basis of local adaptation will evolve through time, and eventually trade-offs between alleles at a locus may occur in the different environments (antagonistic pleiotropy). Key Concepts Key Concepts * Local adaptation is widespread in plants but its genetic basis is still poorly known. * Local adaptation is the property of a group of populations in a given set of environments. * Local adaptation depends primarily on the balance between selection and migration. * The genetic architecture of local adaptation, in particular the presence of trade-offs, is likely to be variable among species as it will depend, among other things, on the time since the populations diverged or the amount of gene flow between them.},

abstract = {Landscape genomics is an emerging research field that aims to identify the environmental factors that shape adaptive genetic variation and the gene variants that drive local adaptation. Its development has been facilitated by next-generation sequencing, which allows for screening thousands to millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in many individuals and populations at reasonable costs. In parallel, datasets describing environmental factors have greatly improved and increasingly become publicly accessible. Accordingly, numerous analytical methods for environmental association studies have been developed. Environmental association analysis identifies genetic variants associated with particular environmental factors and has the potential to uncover adaptive patterns that are not discovered by traditional tests for the detection of outlier loci based on population genetic differentiation. We review methods for conducting environmental association analysis including categorical tests, logistic regressions, matrix correlations, general linear models, and mixed effects models. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches, provide a list of dedicated software packages and their specific properties, and stress the importance of incorporating neutral genetic structure in the analysis. We also touch on additional important aspects such as sampling design, environmental data preparation, pooled and reduced-representation sequencing, candidate gene approaches, linearity of allele-environment associations, and the combination of environmental association analyses with traditional outlier detection tests. We conclude by summarizing expected future directions in the field, such as the extension of statistical approaches, environmental association analysis for ecological gene annotation, and the need for replication and post-hoc validation studies.

abstract = {Environmental filtering, where the environment selects against certain species, is thought to be a major mechanism structuring communities. However, recent criticisms cast doubt on our ability to accurately infer filtering because competition can give rise to patterns identical to those caused by environmental filtering. While experiments can distinguish mechanisms, observational patterns are especially problematic. The environment determines community composition not only directly via survival, but also by influencing competition. If species population growth rates covary with environmental gradients, then outcomes of competitive exclusion will also vary with the environment. Here, we argue that observational studies remain valuable, but inferences about the importance of the environment cannot rely on compositional data alone, and that species abundances, population growth, or traits must be correlated with the environment. The role of the environment for shaping community composition has been criticized recently.Other mechanisms, such as competition, could produce similar patterns to environmental filtering.We recognize that competition and the environment do not have separable affects on species and their interactions.Researchers should use additional information to determine whether fitness-environment covariances influence composition.},

abstract = {Variation is a central topic, both conceptually and historically in evolutionary biology. Phenotypic variation was Darwin's fundamental observation. Indeed, the first two chapters of On the Origin of Species deal explicitly with variation. Variation within and among species has certainly been as central to the thinking of Ernst Mayr (1963) as it was to the thinking of Sewall Wright (1968), two of the fathers of the modern synthesis. However, the study of variability or the propensity to vary, with few exceptions, has remained peripheral to study of the mechanisms of evolutionary change at any level of the biological hierarchy. Although implicit in virtually all research in the biological sciences, whether one is seeking understanding at the genetic, developmental, organismal, species, population, or ecologic/community levels, variation is seldom treated as a subject in and of itself. Variation is an extremely broad topic, and a modern treatment of this subject is not possible without a thematic focus. This chapter introduces this theme through both a hierarchical treatment and integrative approaches that point toward new directions of research. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Considering both within- and between-species functional diversities in plant communities has been recently suggested as a way to understand potential assembly mechanisms that control species coexistence. In particular, relating variations in species richness to within- and between-species functional diversities can provide a useful framework for evaluating the importance of alternative community assembly theories. In addition, little is known about whether the relationship between species richness and functional diversity components arises from direct or indirect effects of the abiotic environment. We tested the relationship between functional diversity and species richness by disentangling functional diversity components into within-species, between-species and total functional diversities and by considering potential direct and indirect effects of the abiotic conditions. Multi- and single-trait approaches were applied using three key plant functional traits (height, specific leaf area (SLA), LDMC). Traits were measured on species coexisting across sixteen species-rich limestone grasslands. Direct and indirect effects of the abiotic conditions were evaluated using multiple soil properties including heterogeneity in soil depths. The within-species functional diversity ranged between 13.5{\%} and 33.6{\%} of the total functional diversity. Within-species diversity was the main functional component linked to variations in species richness, despite the within-species functional diversity being lower than between-species functional diversity. Environmental soil properties had a direct effect on species richness but did not affect functional diversity components. Synthesis: Our results provide evidence that increasing the trait overlap between species, due to an increase in within-species diversity, may relate to greater species coexistence. Disentangling multiple functional diversity components indicated that there may be equalizing mechanisms that act as potential drivers of species coexistence. In addition, it suggests the possibility that this approach may provide a better understanding of the processes involved in the structure of plant communities.

abstract = {A permanent plot of 28 ha was established in a dense wet evergreen forest in the Western Ghats of India to study the functioning of the ecosystem. Since April 1990, 1981 trees of ≥30 cm gbh have been enumerated in a systematic sampling of five strips totalling 3.12 ha. This paper describes the main structural and floristic characteristics of the plot. The density (635 trees ≥30 cm gbh per hectare) and basal area (39.7 m 2 ha −1 ) are high. Despite the high diversity (Simpson's D = 0.92 and Shannon's H' = 4.56), four species are distinctly, dominant in terms of an importance value index (relative density + relative basal area). Each of these four species occupies a different layer in the ecosystem: Humboldtia brunonis Wall. (Fabaceae) dominates the undergrowth, Myristica dactylo{\"{i}}des Gaertn. (Myristicaceae) the intermediate strata, Valeria indica L. (Dipterocarpaceae) the higher canopy level and Dipterocarpus indicus Bedd. (Dipterocarpaceae) the emergents. This pronounced species hierarchy is one of the most important characteristics of the evergreen forests of the Western Ghats. The two dipterocarps account for 20.1{\%} of the total number of trees and contribute 40.9{\%} to the total basal area. This formation can, therefore, be considered as the westernmost lowland dipterocarp forest of Asia. Analysis of the spatial variations in the floristic composition and in the structure of the main species populations shows that two kinds of mature phases can be identified: where the topography is raised and gently sloping, the vertical structure of the stand is discontinuous, with Dipterocarpus indicus and Vateria indica forming an emergent layer above a dense undergrowth; on slopes, the stand is lower, vertically continuous and saturated with Valeria indica and Myristica dactylo{\"{i}}des . The link between the structure of the stand and dynamic processes is discussed.},

abstract = {Tropical tree wood density is often related to other species-specific functional traits, e.g. size, growth rate and mortality. We would therefore expect significant associations within tropical forests between the spatial distributions of stand-level wood density and micro-environments when interspecific variation in wood density is larger than intraspecific variation and when habitat-based species assembly is important in the forest. In this study, we used wood cores collected from 515 trees of 72 species in a 15-ha plot in northern Thailand to analyse intra- and interspecific variation in wood density and the spatial association of stand-level wood density. Intraspecific variation was lower than interspecific variation (20{\%} vs. 80{\%} of the total variation), indicating that species-specific differences in wood density, rather than phenotypic plasticity, are the major source of variation in wood density at the study site. Wood density of individual species was significantly negatively related to maximum diameter, growth rate of sapling diameter and mortality of saplings. Stand-level mean wood density was significantly negatively related to elevation, slope convexity, sapling growth rate and sapling mortality, and positively related to slope inclination. East-facing slopes had significantly lower stand-level mean wood densities than west-facing slopes. We hypothesized that ridges and east-facing slopes in the study forest experience strong and frequent wind disturbance, and that this severe impact may lead to faster stand turnover, creating conditions that favour fast-growing species with low wood density. {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2009.},

abstract = {The prevalence of phylogenetic niche conservatism (PNC) in nature is still a conflicting issue. Disagreement arises from confusion over its precise definition and the variety of approaches to measure its prevalence. Recent work highlighted that common measures of PNC strongly depend on the assumptions of the underlying model of niche evolution. However, this warning has not been well recognized in the applied literature and questionable approaches are still frequently applied. The aim of this study is to draw attention to the assumptions underlying commonly applied simple measures of PNC. We used a series of simulations to illustrate how misleading results can be if assumptions of niche evolution are violated, that the violation of assumptions is a common phenomenon and that testing assumptions requires in-depth pretest. We conclude that the seemingly simple measures of PNC, such as phylogenetic signal (PS) and evolutionary rate, are not so easy to apply if one accounts for the necessity to test model assumptions. In addition, these measures can be difficult to interpret. The common assumption that strong PS indicates PNC will be often invalid. In addition, the interpretation of some measures, for example the conclusion that evolutionary rate is slow enough to indicate PNC, requires a comparison with another clade, another trait or well-developed null model assumptions and thus additional data. We suggest that studies investigating PNC should always compare alternative evolutionary models and that model comparisons should in particular include flexible niche evolution models such as multiple-optima OU models, although these are computational intensive. These models are directly inherited from the concept of macroevolutionary adaptive landscape and can indicate PNC either by relative few peak shifts or by narrow peaks in the adaptive landscape. A test of PNC thus requires comparing these parameters of the macroevolutionary landscape between clades or time periods. The general prevalence of PNC in nature should be evaluated only based on studies keeping up to the high standards of communicating the used definition of PNC, testing the assumptions made in the modelling approaches and including newly developed models in a model comparison approach.},

abstract = {A sequence of red through yellow to grey soils from well drained hilltops to poorly drained valleys is common on the backslopes of the Western Ghaˆts, Southern India. Detailed field observations along a representative toposequence developed from weathered schists, and local petrographic, mineralogical and chemical investigations are used to (i) link yellow, white and brown features to yellowing, bleaching and ferritisation processes, and (ii) relate the enlargement of these features and the development of these processes to aquic and drainage conditions. Precise demarcation of soil morphological features at toposequence scale permits to differentiate an upslope ferralitic domain from a dowslope hydromorphic domain. In each of these domains, geometrical relationships expressed in terms of either concordance or discordance between horizon and colour boundaries are taken as arguments to point out that aquic conditions have expanded upslope in the landscape at some time in the past. As a consequence partial and selective dissolution of iron oxides resulted in yellowing of reddish soil material. Dissolution which affected first hematite then gcethite was controlled by Al substitution in the crystal structure of iron oxides. It has been reproduced in the laboratory using a chemical reducing agent. Yellowing is associated with the onset of aquic conditions: yellow colours occur predominantly at the periphery of the hydromorphic domain. In the hydromorphic domain, complete removal of iron oxides similarly resulted in bleaching of yellow materials and was linked to waterlogging. Iron mobilized by yellowing and bleaching processes moved along established flow paths, and locally crystallized and concentrated in saprolite by ferritisation. Bleaching and ferritisation occurred downslope and downward into the soil to form the inner white-brown zone of the hydromorphic domain. The amount of iron stored in low lying positions and the development of weakly weathering conditions suggest that the internal drainage of the ground watertables was limited. This study cannot conclude if yellowing, bleaching and ferritisation are still actively occurring, as no hydo-geochemical investigations were conducted along the toposequence.},

abstract = {In tropical plant communities with diverse species, many congeners are found to coexist. Do environment or biotic interactions structure the coexistence of congeners in tropical forest communities? In this paper, we aimed to disentangle the effect of environment (first-order effects) and species interactions (second-order effects) on the spatial distributions of tree species. We used a classification scheme and torus-translation to test the first-order interaction of 48 species from 17 genera in a fully mapped 20-ha dipterocarp tropical seasonal rain-forest plot in Xishuangbanna, south-west China. Then we used heterogeneous Poisson null models to reveal significant uni- and bivariate second-order interactions. The results demonstrated that (1) 34 of the 48 studied species showed a significant relation with at least one topographic variable. This confirmed that topographical heterogeneity is important for distribution of these congeners. Spatial segregation (36.6{\%}) and partial overlap (34.8{\%}) were the most common bivariate association types in Xishuangbanna plot, which indicated first-order effects (environment) were strong. (2) For small-scale associations, 51{\%} saplings (1 to ≤ 5 cm) (68.8{\%} for large trees with dbh {\textgreater} 5 cm) of the species showed non-significant associations. For large-scale associations, 61.6{\%} saplings (81.2{\%} for large trees) of the species showed non-significant associations. Lack of significant species interactions provides evidence for the unified neutral theory. In conclusion, both environment and biotic interactions structure congeneric species' coexistence in tropical seasonal rain forest in this region.},

abstract = {Use of the term “functional" trait has increased exponentially in ecology. Although accounting for numerous ecological questions, this concept raises several issues. We propose that the term “functional” could be misleading because (1) no rigorous criteria exist to identify “functional” traits and (2) it suggests that only some traits (“functional” ones) can inform our understanding of species functioning, whatever the scale or discipline. Hence, the concept of "functional" trait in ecology is starting to be challenged and it remains unclear why some traits should be considered functional, whereas other traits should not. We argue that the most used “functional” traits are meaningful because they reflect important differences between populations or species, based on synchronic comparisons, that is, irrespective of time (hereafter “pattern” traits). Hence, they are useful for identifying trade-offs and strategies across large numbers of observations, usually at rather coarse scales, and are most often used in analyses of “big data.” However, given that many ecological processes occur across short time scales and narrow gradients of climate and resource availability, the efficacy of these traits to inform us about these ecological processes appears questionable. We show that trait measurements that take time explicitly into account (hereafter “process” traits) differ from pattern traits because they quantify the flows of material and energy within a given environment across a defined period of time. Although pattern traits and process traits are both functional, it is important to understand the differences between the approaches. Moreover, better accounting of ontogeny, life form, plasticity, and genetic variability is required to enhance the convergence between pattern and process approaches. This revised framework allows more explicit connections between trait ecology and other biological sciences. It should enhance the study of processes at all scales in order to investigate efficiently the adaptive responses of biological organisms to climate change.},

abstract = {Aim Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that climate is a major determinant of species richness, yet the importance of climate relative to local site conditions remains unclear in forest ecosystems across large regions. Furthermore, little is known about how climate and local site conditions affect species evenness and understorey plant diversity. Location Canadian forest (42°37′ to 68°14′ N; 53°25′ to 134°46′ W; 4 to 2170 m elevation). Methods Using national, broad-scale forest inventory data, we tested the influence of growing degree days (GDD), climate moisture index (CMI), soil drainage class (SDC) and stand age (SA) on plant diversity across Canada's forests. Diversity was assessed on variable plot sizes from 125 to 500 m2 for canopy tree and total plant species, and from 100 to 400 m2 for understorey plants. Results Our models accounted for 47, 30 and 49{\%} of total variation in canopy tree species richness, Simpson's dominance index and total plant species richness, respectively. After accounting for the effects of plot size and management history, canopy richness increased with GDD and CMI and peaked at intermediate SDC and SA. Simpson's dominance index decreased with increasing GDD and CMI and was lowest at intermediate SDC and SA. Total species richness was most strongly related to SDC and was highest on imperfectly drained soils. Climatic controls on species richness of understorey strata were generally weaker than those on canopy richness. Main conclusions Our results for canopy richness along a mainly longitudinal gradient demonstrate the positive effects of energy on tree species diversity and show evidence for the effects of local site conditions and secondary succession on diversity. Furthermore, our results show that the extent of the influence of climate and local site conditions on plant species diversity can strongly differ between vegetation strata.},

abstract = {While phenotypic plasticity is considered the major means that allows plant to cope with environmental heteroge-neity, scant information is available on phenotypic plasticity of the whole-plant architecture in relation to ontogenic processes. We performed an architectural analysis to gain an understanding of the structural and ontogenic properties of common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica L., Rhamnaceae) growing in the understory and under an open canopy. We found that ontogenic effects on growth need to be calibrated if a full description of phenotypic plasticity is to be obtained. Our analysis pointed to three levels of organization (or nested structural units) in R. cathartica. Their modulation in relation to light conditions leads to the expression of two architectural strategies that involve sets of traits known to confer competitive advantage in their respective environments. In the understory, the plant develops a tree-like form. Its strategy here is based on restricting investment in exploitation structures while promoting major vertical exploration and is probably key to species survival in the understory. Under an open canopy, the second strategy leads the plant to adopt a shrub-like shape. It develops densely branched exploitation structures and flowers abundantly and rapidly. This strategy perfectly matches its aggressive behaviour observed in full sunlight. We propose, as hypotheses, that these two light-related strategies are implicated in the ability of R. cathartica to outcompete the surrounding vegetation in a range of environmental conditions. Key words: common buckthorn, light environment, plant architecture, plant behaviour, plant functioning, phenotypic plasticity.

abstract = {New burned area datasets and top-down constraints from atmospheric concentration measurements of pyrogenic gases have decreased the large uncertainty in fire emissions estimates. However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the contribution of deforestation, savanna, forest, agricultural waste, and peat fires to total global fire emissions. Here we used a revised version of the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) biogeochemical model and improved satellite-derived estimates of area burned, fire activity, and plant productivity to calculate fire emissions for the 19972009 period on a 0.5 spatial resolution with a monthly time step. For November 2000 onwards, estimates were based on burned area, active fire detections, and plant productivity from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. For the partitioning we focused on the MODIS era. We used maps of burned area derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) and Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) active fire data prior to MODIS (19972000) and estimates of plant productivity derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) observations during the same period. Average global fire carbon emissions according to this version 3 of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED3) were 2.0 Pg C year1 with significant interannual variability during 19972001 (2.8 Pg C year1 in 1998 and 1.6 Pg C year1 in 2001). Globally, emissions during 20022007 were relatively constant (around 2.1 Pg C year1) before declining in 2008 (1.7 Pg C year1) and 2009 (1.5 Pg C year1) partly due to lower deforestation fire emissions in South America and tropical Asia. On a regional basis, emissions were highly variable during 20022007 (e.g., boreal Asia, South America, and Indonesia), but these regional differences canceled out at a global level. During the MODIS era (20012009), most carbon emissions were from fires in grasslands and savannas (44{\%}) with smaller contributions from tropical deforestation and degradation fires (20{\%}), woodland fires (mostly confined to the tropics, 16{\%}), forest fires (mostly in the extratropics, 15{\%}), agricultural waste burning (3{\%}), and tropical peat fires (3{\%}). The contribution from agricultural waste fires was likely a lower bound because our approach for measuring burned area could not detect all of these relatively small fires. Total carbon emissions were on average 13{\%} lower than in our previous (GFED2) work. For reduced trace gases such as CO and CH4, deforestation, degradation, and peat fires were more important contributors because of higher emissions of reduced trace gases per unit carbon combusted compared to savanna fires. Carbon emissions from tropical deforestation, degradation, and peatland fires were on average 0.5 Pg C year1. The carbon emissions from these fires may not be balanced by regrowth following fire. Our results provide the first global assessment of the contribution of different sources to total global fire emissions for the past decade, and supply the community with an improved 13-year fire emissions time series.},

For tropical trees, specialization for particular soil resource and topographic conditions is an important part of the habitat niche, influencing the distributions of individual species and overall tree community structure at the local scale. However, little is known about how these habitat niches are related to the evolutionary history of species. We assessed the relationship between taxonomic rank and tree species' soil resource and topographic niches in eight large (24-50 ha) tropical forest dynamics plots. Niche overlap values, indicating the similarity of two species' distributions along soil or topographic axes, were calculated for all pairwise combinations of co-occurring tree species at each study site. Congeneric species pairs often showed greater niche overlap (i.e., more similar niches) than non-congeneric pairs along both soil and topographic axes, though significant effects were found for only five sites based on Mantel tests. No evidence for taxonomic effects was found at the family level. Our results indicate that local habitat niches of trees exhibit varying degrees of phylogenetic signal at different sites, which may have important ramifications for the phylogenetic structure of these communities. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Mortality was higher on north slopes, while growth and recruitment rates were not significantly different among positions. Soil pH and effects of recent disturbance by Hurricane Gilbert were positively correlated with growth and recruitment, while slope angle and disturbance effects were the best predictors of mortality. The patterns we found in Jamaica, that growth and recruitment were not higher on ridge crests than slopes, are different than those found by Herwitz and Young in Australia where growth and turnover were greater on a ridge crest. Therefore, it is not possible at present to make simple generalizations about dynamics of ridge crest versus slope forests in the montane tropics.},

abstract = {Assessments of the long-term natural regeneration of tropical forests following selective logging are today mostly based on extrapolation of limited empirical observations. Mounting evidence suggests that current logging policies overestimate forest regrowth by a wide margin, and are therefore not sustainable. The need for more reliable assessment of natural forest growth dynamics has led to the development of a vertically and spatially structured dynamic simulation model of natural forest development. The model accounts explicitly for biomass and tree numbers in five distinct canopy layers (seedlings, saplings, poles, main canopy, emergents). Energy accounting of assimilation and dissimilation rates leads to biomass, diameter, and height growth in each layer. Leaf mass in each layer determines photoproduction, and light and photosynthesis conditions in lower layers. Transitions to higher layers, mortalities in each layer, and seed events are accounted for. The basic model simulates the development dynamics of a forest gap. Parallel computation of spatially distributed single gap models with stochastic mortalities and seed dispersal provides a simulation of the spatial dynamics of the tropical forest mosaic. Simulation results are provided with parameters corresponding to unlogged and logged Malaysian lowland dipterocarp forest. ?? 1991.},

One of the main goals of these plots has been to evaluate spatial patterns in tropical tree populations. Here the degree of aggregation in the distribution of 1768 tree species is examined based on the average density of conspecific trees in circular neighborhoods around each tree. When all individuals larger than 1 centimeter in stem diameter were included, nearly every species was more aggregated than a random distribution. Considering only larger trees (greater than or equal to 10 centimeters in diameter), the pattern persisted, with most species being more aggregated than random. Rare species were more aggregated than common species. All six forests were very similar in all the particulars of these results.},

With the recent arrival of large genome-wide data sets on human variation, there is now unprecedented opportunity for progress on this type of question. Several lines of evidence argue for an important role of positive selection in shaping human variation and differences among populations. These include studies of comparative morphology and physiology, as well as population genetic studies of candidate loci and genome-wide data. However, the data also suggest that it is unusual for strong selection to drive new mutations rapidly to fixation in particular populations (the 'hard sweep' model). We argue, instead, for alternatives to the hard sweep model: in particular, polygenic adaptation could allow rapid adaptation while not producing classical signatures of selective sweeps. We close by discussing some of the likely opportunities for progress in the field. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Woody perennial angiosperms (i.e., hardwood trees) are polyphyletic in origin and occur in most angiosperm orders. Despite their independent origins, hardwoods have shared physiological, anatomical, and life history traits distinct from their herbaceous relatives. New high-throughput DNA sequencing platforms have provided access to numerous woody plant genomes beyond the early reference genomes of Populus and Eucalyptus, references that now include willow and oak, with pecan and chestnut soon to follow. Genomic studies within these diverse and undomesticated species have successfully linked genes to ecological, physiological, and developmental traits directly. Moreover, comparative genomic approaches are providing insights into speciation events while large-scale DNA resequencing of native collections is identifying population-level genetic diversity responsible for variation in key woody plant biology across and within species. Current research is focused on developing genomic prediction models for breeding, defining speciation and local adaptation, detecting and characterizing somatic mutations, revealing the mechanisms of gender determination and flowering, and application of systems biology approaches to model complex regulatory networks underlying quantitative traits. Emerging technologies such as single-molecule, long-read sequencing is being employed as additional woody plant species, and genotypes within species, are sequenced, thus enabling a comparative (“evo-devo”) approach to understanding the unique biology of large woody plants. Resource availability, current genomic and genetic applications, new discoveries and predicted future developments are illustrated and discussed for poplar, eucalyptus, willow, oak, chestnut, and pecan.},

abstract = {Diameter, height, crown shape, and crown area were measured on 23—42 trees ranging in size from saplings to large adults for each of eight common dicotyledonous tree species in a neotropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Six species were canopy trees, one species was an emergent tree, and the remaining species was an understory tree. Crown areas and shapes were quantified by eight radii measured every 45° from the trunk to the vertically projected edge of the crown. areas were calculated from the areas of circles with the average radius; crown shapes were measured by the coefficients of variation of the eight crown radii. Age—diameter relationships were estimated from diameter growth increments over an 8—yr period. Observed height—diameter relationships were compared to expectations based on the theories of elastic similarity, constant stress, and geometric similarity. Slopes of log—transformed height—diameter relationships differed from the theoretically expected value of 2/3 for elastic similarity in three of eight species; two canopy species had higher slopes, but not as high as the expected value of 1.0 for geometric similarity; one canopy species was shorter, but the slope was greater than the slope of 0.5 predicted by the constant stress theory. The theory of elastic similarity also predicts that canopy mass to trunk mass ratio should remain constant during tree growth. Observed ratios based on proxy variables for the masses were constant in six of eight species–the two deviant species had heavier crowns in large trees than expected from their diameters. Crown shapes were much more variable in some species than others. The understory species had much lower r2 values for height—diameter and crown—diameter relationships, suggesting that these relationships may be more variable in trees that live in the less windy understory than in trees that reach the canopy. The allometric relationships for the species in this study were not unique for each species, suggesting that it may be possible to model the allometric relationships of many species with fewer equations than species. If the primary adaptive forces acting on tree species in a diverse forest are their physical environment and the sum of competitive interactions with an ever—changing mix of neighbors, then different species may have similar resource allocation patterns. Thus, using the age—size relationships, we found three groups of species among the seven canopy species. Two groups had three species each and one species (Ocotea whitei) was in a group by itself. The understory species, Faramea occidentalis, was also in a group by itself.},

One of the most important pieces of information is the variation with height in leaf area density, p (m2 leaf area per m3 canopy volume), but it is notoriously difficult to measure this in forest canopies. Consequently, very few data on p exist for tall tropical forests. We describe a relatively rapid photographic method to make this measurement and we demonstrate its use for a rain forest in Cameroon, and two rain forests in Brazil. The method requires an assumption or knowledge of leaf angle distribution, but is relatively rapid and has the benefit of sampling a relatively large volume of canopy. The technique works adequately, especially if the leaf area index of the site is already known; the results agree quantitatively and qualitatively with previous more laborious determinations.

abstract = {Convergence in interspecific leaf trait relationships across diverse taxonomic groups and biomes would have important evolutionary and ecological implications. Such convergence has been hypothesized to result from trade-offs that limit the combination of plant traits for any species. Here we address this issue by testing for biome differences in the slope and intercept of interspecific relationships among leaf traits: longevity, net photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), leaf diffusive conductance (G(s)), specific leaf area (SLA), and nitrogen (N) status, for more than 100 species in six distinct biomes of the Americas. The six biomes were: alpine tundra-subalpine forest ecotone, cold temperate forest-prairie ecotone, montane cool temperate forest, desert shrubland, subtropical forest, and tropical rain forest. Despite large differences in climate and evolutionary history, in all biomes mass-based leaf N (N(mass)), SLA, G(s), and A(max) were positively related to one another and decreased with increasing leaf life span. The relationships between pairs of leaf traits exhibited similar slopes among biomes, suggesting a predictable set of scaling relationships among key leaf morphological, chemical, and metabolic traits that are replicated globally among terrestrial ecosystems regardless of biome or vegetation type. However, the intercept (i.e., the overall elevation of regression lines) of relationships between pairs of leaf traits usually differed among biomes. With increasing aridity across sites, species had greater Amax for a given level of G(s) and lower SLA for any given leaf life span. Using principal components analysis, most variation among species was explained by an axis related to mass-based leaf traits (A(max), N, and SLA) while a second axis reflected climate, G(s), and other area-based leaf traits.},

abstract = {Enormous progress in mapping complex traits in humans has been made in the last 5 yr. There has been early success for prevalent diseases with complex phenotypes. These studies have demonstrated clearly that, while complex traits differ in their underlying genetic architectures, for many common disorders the predominant pattern is that of many loci, individually with small effects on phenotype. For some traits, loci of large effect have been identified. For almost all complex traits studied in humans, the sum of the identified genetic effects comprises only a portion, generally less than half, of the estimated trait heritability. A variety of hypotheses have been proposed to explain why this might be the case, including untested rare variants, and gene–gene and gene–environment interaction. Effort is currently being directed toward implementation of novel analytic approaches and testing rare variants for association with complex traits using imputed variants from the publicly available 1000 Genomes Project resequencing data and from direct resequencing of clinical samples. Through integration with annotations and functional genomic data as well as by in vitro and in vivo experimentation, mapping studies continue to characterize functional variants associated with complex traits and address fundamental issues such as epistasis and pleiotropy. This review focuses primarily on the ways in which genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revolutionized the field of human quantitative genetics.},

We studied the relationship between aboveground tree biomass dynamics ($\Delta$biomass) and multiple dimensions of biodiversity over 8–16 years in eight successional rainforests. We tested whether successional changes in diversity–$\Delta$biomass correlations reflect predictions of niche theories. Diversity–$\Delta$biomass correlations were positive early but weak later in succession, suggesting saturation of niche space with increasing diversity. Early in succession, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity in two leaf traits exhibited the strongest positive correlations with $\Delta$biomass, indicating complementarity or positive selection effects. In mid-successional stands, high biodiversity was associated with greater mortality-driven biomass loss, i.e. negative selection effects, suggesting successional niche trade-offs and loss of fast-growing pioneer species. Our results demonstrate that BEF relationships are dynamic across succession, thus successional context is essential to understanding BEF in a given system.},

abstract = {Functional trait diversity is a popular tool in modern ecology, mainly used to infer assembly processes and ecosystem functioning. Patterns of functional trait diversity are shaped by ecological processes such as environmental filtering, species interactions and dispersal that are inherently spatial, and different processes may operate at different spatial scales. Adding a spatial dimension to the analysis of functional trait diversity may thus increase our ability to infer community assembly processes and to predict change in assembly processes following disturbance or land-use change. Richness, evenness and divergence of functional traits are commonly used indices of functional trait diversity that are known to respond differently to large-scale filters related to environmental heterogeneity and dispersal and fine-scale filters related to species interactions (competition). Recent developments in spatial statistics make it possible to separately quantify large-scale patterns (variation in local means) and fine-scale patterns (variation around local means) by decomposing overall spatial autocorrelation quantified by Moran's coefficient into its positive and negative components using Moran eigenvector maps (MEM). We thus propose to identify the spatial signature of multiple ecological processes that are potentially acting at different spatial scales by contrasting positive and negative components of spatial autocorrelation for each of the three indices of functional trait diversity. We illustrate this approach with a case study from riparian plant communities, where we test the effects of disturbance on spatial patterns of functional trait diversity. The fine-scale pattern of all three indices was increased in the disturbed versus control habitat, suggesting an increase in local scale competition and an overall increase in unexplained variance in the post-disturbance versus control community. Further research using simulation modeling should focus on establishing the proposed link between community assembly rules and spatial patterns of functional trait diversity to maximize our ability to infer multiple processes from spatial community structure.},

StAMPP provides an advance on previous similar software packages, due to an ability to calculate pairwise FST values along with confidence intervals, Nei's genetic distance and genomic relationship matrixes from data sets of mixed-ploidy level. The software code is designed to efficiently handle analysis of large genotypic data sets that are typically generated by high-throughput genotyping platforms.

abstract = {Climate change threatens ecosystems worldwide, yet their potential future resilience remains largely unquantified1 . In recent years many studies have shown that biodiversity, and in particular functional diversity, can enhance ecosystem resilience by providing a higher response diversity2–5 . So far these insights have been mostly neglected in large-scale projections of ecosystem responses to climate change6 . Here we show that plant trait diversity, as a key component of functional diversity, can have a strikingly positive effect on the Amazon forests' biomass under future climate change. Using a terrestrial biogeochemical model that simulates diverse forest communities on the basis of individual tree growth7 , we show that plant trait diversity may enable the Amazon forests to adjust to new climate conditions via a process of ecological sorting, protecting the Amazon's carbon sink function. Therefore, plant trait diversity, and biodiversity in general, should be considered in large-scale ecosystem projections and be included as an integral part of climate change research and policy.},

abstract = {Most adaptive traits are controlled by large number of genes that may all together be the targets of selection. Adaptation may thus involve multiple but not necessarily substantial allele frequency changes. This has important consequences for the detection of selected loci and implies that a quantitative genetics framework may be more appropriate than the classical 'selective sweep' paradigm. Preferred methods to detect loci involved in local adaptation are based on the detection of 'outlier' values of the allelic differentiation F(ST) . A quantitative genetics framework is adopted here to review theoretical expectations for how allelic differentiation at quantitative trait loci (F(STQ) ) relates to (i), neutral genetic differentiation (F(ST) ) and (ii), phenotypic differentiation (Q(ST) ). We identify cases where results of outlier-based methods are likely to be poor and where differentiation at selected loci conveys little information regarding local adaptation. A first case is when neutral differentiation is high, so that local adaptation does not necessitate increased differentiation. A second case is when local adaptation is reached via an increased covariance of allelic effects rather than via allele frequency changes, which is more likely under high gene flow when the number of loci is high and selection is recent. The comparison of theoretical predictions with observed data from the literature suggests that polygenic local adaptation involving only faint allele frequency changes are very likely in some species such as forest trees and for climate-related traits. Recent methodological improvements that may alleviate the weakness of F(ST) -based detection methods are presented. 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Resolving the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has been one of the central goals of modern ecology. Early debates about the relationship were finally resolved with the advent of a statistical partitioning scheme that decomposed the biodiversity effect into a "selection" effect and a "complementarity" effect. We prove that both the biodiversity effect and its statistical decomposition into selection and complementarity are fundamentally flawed because these methods use a na$\backslash$"ive null expectation based on neutrality, likely leading to an overestimate of the net biodiversity effect, and they fail to account for the nonlinear abundance-ecosystem functioning relationships observed in nature. Furthermore, under such nonlinearity no statistical scheme can be devised to partition the biodiversity effects. We also present an alternative metric providing a more reasonable estimate of biodiversity effect. Our results suggest that all studies conducted since the early 1990s likely overestimated the positive effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {Land-use change occurs nowhere more rapidly than in the tropics, where the imbalance between deforestation and forest regrowth has large consequences for the global carbon cycle. However, considerable uncertainty remains about the rate of biomass recovery in secondary forests, and how these rates are influenced by climate, landscape, and prior land use. Here we analyse aboveground biomass recovery during secondary succession in 45 forest sites and about 1,500 forest plots covering the major environmental gradients in the Neotropics. The studied secondary forests are highly productive and resilient. Aboveground biomass recovery after 20 years was on average 122 megagrams per hectare (Mg ha(-1)), corresponding to a net carbon uptake of 3.05 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), 11 times the uptake rate of old-growth forests. Aboveground biomass stocks took a median time of 66 years to recover to 90{\%} of old-growth values. Aboveground biomass recovery after 20 years varied 11.3-fold (from 20 to 225 Mg ha(-1)) across sites, and this recovery increased with water availability (higher local rainfall and lower climatic water deficit). We present a biomass recovery map of Latin America, which illustrates geographical and climatic variation in carbon sequestration potential during forest regrowth. The map will support policies to minimize forest loss in areas where biomass resilience is naturally low (such as seasonally dry forest regions) and promote forest regeneration and restoration in humid tropical lowland areas with high biomass resilience.},

abstract = {Hybridisation may lead to introgression of genes among species. Introgression may be bidirectional or unidirectional, depending on factors such as the demography of the hybridising species, or the nature of reproductive barriers between them. Previous microsatellite studies suggested bidirectional introgression between diploid Betula nana (dwarf birch) and tetraploid B. pubescens (downy birch) and also between B. pubescens and diploid B. pendula (silver birch) in Britain. Here we analyse introgression among these species using 51,237 variants in restriction-site associated (RAD) markers in 194 individuals, called with allele dosages in the tetraploids. In contrast to the microsatellite study, we found unidirectional introgression into B. pubescens from both of the diploid species. This pattern fits better with the expected nature of the reproductive barrier between diploids and tetraploids. As in the microsatellite study, introgression into B. pubescens showed clear clines with increasing introgression from B. nana in the north and from B. pendula in the south. Unlike B. pendula alleles, introgression of B. nana alleles was found far from the current area of sympatry or allopatry between B. nana and B. pubescens. This pattern fits a shifting zone of hybridisation due to Holocene reduction in the range of B. nana, and expansion in the range of B. pubescens. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {-Interacting phenotypes are traits whose expression is affected by interactions with conspecifics. Commonly-studied interacting phenotypes include aggression, courtship, and communication. More extreme examples of inter-acting phenotypes-traits that exist exclusively as a product of interactions-include social dominance, intraspecific competitive ability, and mating systems, We adopt a quantitative genetic approach to assess genetic influences on interacting phenotypes. We partition genetic and environmental effects so that traits in conspecifics that influence the expression of interacting phenotypes are a component of the environment. When the trait having the effect is heritable, the environmental influence arising from the interaction has a genetic basis and can be incorporated as an indirect genetic effect. However, because it has a genetic basis, this environmental component can evolve. Therefore, to consider the evolution of interacting phenotypes we simultaneously consider changes in the direct genetic contributions to a trait (as a standard quantitative genetic approach would evaluate) as well as changes in the environmental (indirect genetic) contribution to the phenotype, We then explore the ramifications of this model of inheritance on the evolution of interacting phenotypes. The relative rate of evolution in interacting phenotypes can be quite different from that predicted by a standard quantitative genetic analysis. Phenotypic evolution is greatly enhanced or inhibited depending on the nature of the direct and indirect genetic effects. Further, unlike most models of phenotypic evolution, a lack of variation in direct genetic effects does not preclude evolution if there is genetic variance in the indirect genetic contributions. The available empirical evidence regarding the evolution of behavior expressed in interactions, although limited, supports the predictions of our model.},

Four Mediterranean tree species were modelled for comparison. Variables selected by models were relatively consistent across scales and the predictive accuracy of models varied only slightly. However, there were slight differences in the performance of methods. Classification tree analysis had a lower accuracy than the generalized methods, especially at finer scales. The performance of generalized linear models also increased with scale. At the fine scale GLM with linear terms showed better accuracy than GLM with quadratic and polynomial terms. This is probably because distributions at finer scales represent a linear sub-sample of entire realized niches of species. In contrast to GLM, the performance of GAM was constant across scales being more data-oriented. The predictive accuracy of GAM was always at least equal to other techniques, suggesting that this modelling approach is more robust to variations of scale because it can deal with any response shape.

abstract = {The plant economics spectrum that integrates the combination of leaf and wood syndromes provides a useful framework for the examination of species strategies at the whole-plant level. However, it remains unclear how species that differ in leaf habits and growth forms are integrated within the plant economics spectrum in subtropical forests. We measured five leaf and six wood traits across 58 subtropical plant species, which represented two leaf habits (evergreen vs deciduous) and two growth forms (tree vs shrub) in eastern China. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed separately to construct the leaf (LES), wood (WES) and whole-plant (WPES) economics spectra. Leaf and wood traits are highly intra-and intercorrelated, thus defining not only the LES and WES, but also a WPES. Multi-trait variations in PCAs revealed that the traits which were representative of the acquisitive strat-egy, i.e., cheap tissue investment and rapid returns on that investment, were clustered at one end, while traits that represented the conservative strategy, i.e., expensive tissue investment and slower returns, were clustered at other end in each of the axes of the leaf and wood syndromes (PC1-axis) and the plant height strategy (PC2-axis). The local WPES, LES and WES were tightly corre-lated with each other. Evergreens shaped the conservative side, while deciduous species structured the acquisitive side of the WPES and LES. With respect to plant height strategies, trees formulated the acquisitive side and shrub species made up the con-servative side of the WPES, LES and WES. In conclusion, our results suggested that the LES and WES were coordinated to a WPES for subtropical species. The finding of this local spectrum of plant form and function would be beneficial for modeling nutrient fluxes and species compositions in the changing climate, but also for understanding species strategies in an evolutionary context.},

abstract = {Intraspecific trait variation is hypothesized to influence the relative importance of community assembly mechanisms. However, few studies have explicitly considered how intraspecific trait variation among ontogenetic stages influences community assembly across environmental gradients. Because the relative importance of abiotic and biotic assembly mechanisms can differ among ontogenetic stages within and across environments, ontogenetic trait variation may have an important influence on patterns of functional diversity and inferred assembly mechanisms. We tested the hypothesis that variation in functional diversity across a topo-edaphic gradient differs among ontogenetic stages and that these patterns reflect a shift in the relative importance of different assembly mechanisms. In a temperate forest in the Missouri Ozarks, USA, we compared functional diversity of leaf size and specific leaf area (SLA) of 34 woody plant species at two ontogenetic stages (adults and saplings) to test predictions about how the relative importance of abiotic and biotic filtering changes among adult and sapling communities. Local communities of adults had lower mean SLA and lower functional dispersion of SLA than expected by chance, particularly at the resource-limited end of the topo-edaphic gradient, suggesting an important role for abiotic filtering among co-occurring adults. In contrast, local communities of saplings often had higher functional dispersion of leaf size and SLA than expected by chance regardless of their location along the topo-edaphic gradient, suggesting an important role for biotic filtering among co-occurring saplings. Moreover, the overall strength of trait-environment relationships varied between saplings and adults for both leaf traits, generally resulting in stronger environmental shifts in mean trait values and trait dispersion for adults relative to saplings. Our results illustrate how community assembly mechanisms may shift in their relative importance during ontogeny, leading to variable patterns of functional diversity across environmental gradients. Moreover, our results highlight the importance of integrating ontogeny, an important axis of intraspecific trait variability, into approaches that use plant functional traits to understand community assembly and species coexistence.},

abstract = {Climate models for the coming century predict rainfall reduction in the Amazonian region, including change in water availability for tropical rainforests. Here, we test the extent to which climate variables related to water regime, temperature and irradiance shape the growth trajectories of neotropical trees. We developed a diameter growth model explicitly designed to work with asynchronous climate and growth data. Growth trajectories of 205 individual trees from 54 neotropical species censused every 2 months over a 4-year period were used to rank 9 climate variables and find the best predictive model. About 9{\%} of the individual variation in tree growth was imputable to the seasonal variation of climate. Relative extractable water was the main predictor and alone explained more than 60{\%} of the climate effect on tree growth, i.e. 5.4{\%} of the individual variation in tree growth. Furthermore, the global annual tree growth was more dependent on the diameter increment at the onset of the rain season than on the duration of dry season. The best predictive model included 3 climate variables: relative extractable water, minimum temperature and irradiance. The root mean squared error of prediction (0.035 mm.d -1) was slightly above the mean value of the growth (0.026 mm.d -1). Amongst climate variables, we highlight the predominant role of water availability in determining seasonal variation in tree growth of neotropical forest trees and the need to include these relationships in forest simulators to test, in silico, the impact of different climate scenarios on the future dynamics of the rainforest. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wagner et al.},

Hybridisation and adaptive introgression have long been thought to be major drivers of their ecological success. Therefore, the maintenance of species barriers remains a key question, given the extent of interspecific gene flow. In this study, we made use of the tremendous genetic variation among four European white oak species (31 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) to infer the evolutionary history of these species, study patterns of genetic differentiation and identify reproductive barriers. We first analysed the ecological and historical relationships among these species and inferred a long-term strict isolation followed by a recent and extensive postglacial contact using approximate Bayesian computation. Assuming this demographic scenario, we then performed backward simulations to generate the expected distributions of differentiation under neutrality to scan their genomes for reproductive barriers. We finally identified important intrinsic and ecological functions driving the reproductive isolation. We discussed the importance of identifying the genetic basis for the ecological preferences between these oak species and its implications for the renewal of European forests under global warming.},

abstract = {Evolutionary transitions between mating systems have occurred repetitively and independently in flowering plants. One of the most spectacular advances of the recent empirical literature in the field was the discovery of the underlying genetic machinery, which provides the opportunity to retrospectively document the scenario of the outcrossing to selfing transitions in a phylogenetic perspective. In this review, we explore the literature describing patterns of polymorphism and molecular evolution of the locus controlling self-incompatibility (S-locus) in selfing species of the Brassicaceae family in order to document the transition from outcrossing to selfing, a retrospective approach that we describe as the 'mating system genes approach'. The data point to strikingly contrasted scenarios of transition from outcrossing to selfing. We also perform original analyses of the fully sequenced genomes of four species showing self-compatibility, to compare the orthologous S-locus region with that of functional S-locus haplotypes. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that all species we investigated evolved independently towards loss of self-incompatibility, and in most cases almost intact sequences of either of the two S-locus genes suggest that these transitions occurred relatively recently. The S-locus region in Aethionema arabicum, representing the most basal lineage of Brassicaceae, showed unusual patterns so that our analysis could not determine whether self-incompatibility was lost secondarily, or evolved in the core Brassicaceae after the split with this basal lineage. Although the approach we detail can only be used when mating system genes have been identified in a clade, we suggest that its integration with phylogenetic and population genetic approaches should help determine the main routes of this predominant mating system shift in plants. {\textcopyright} 2014 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.},

abstract = {Gene flow within and between species is a fundamental process shaping the evolutionary history of taxa. However, the extent of hybridization and reinforcement is little documented in the tropics. Here we explore the pattern of gene flow between three sister species from the herbaceous genus Marantochloa (Marantaceae), sympatrically distributed in the understorey of the African rainforest, using data from the chloroplast and nuclear genomes (DNA sequences and AFLP). We found highly contrasting patterns: while there was no evidence of gene flow between M. congensis and M. monophylla, species identity between M. monophylla and M. incertifolia was maintained despite considerable gene flow. We hypothesize that M. incertifolia originated from an ancient hybridization event between M. congensis and M. monophylla, considering the current absence of hybridization between the two assumed parent species, the rare presence of shared haplotypes between all three species and the high percentage of haplotypes shared by M. incertifolia with each of the two parent species. This example is contrasted with two parapatrically distributed species from the same family in the genus Haumania forming a hybrid zone restricted to the area of overlap. This work illustrates the diversity of speciation/introgression patterns that can potentially occur in the flora of tropical Africa.},

EFFECTS OF A HYDROLOGICAL GRADIENT ON THE STRUCTURE AND DYNAMIC OF A TROPICAL RAIN FOREST (PARACOU, FRENCH GUIANA) Abstract We investigated the relationships between floristic composition and forest dynamics, under the influence of edaphic factors. The study was conducted in 6 permanent plots covering 37.5 hectares at Paracou, French Guiana. In a first time, we analysed the distribution of species in relation to edaphic factors. A single hydrological appeared to organise the species at Paracou. We thus proposed a typology of species according to their position on this gradient. A comparison of this typology with some traits of the species highlighted the preferential association of the heliophile species with a particular habitat: seasonally-flooded soils. In a second time, the effects of edaphic factors on species performance were investigated. Growth models were fitted to take into account both the effects of competition and soil. Growth response appeared generally consistent with the edaphic preferences of species, accordingly with the niche theory. In a third time, the study was finally conducted at the forest level but was limited to the comparison between seasonally-flooded lowland and terra firme forest. The lowlands have a lower density, a more heliophilic flora and a higher turnover while their diametric structure and basal area production are nearly identical to those observed on terra firme. The relationships between density, floristic composition and turnover were deepened, highlighting the central role of mortality, particularly windfallen trees to explain forest dynamics and differences observed between the two environments.},

abstract = {Leaf lifespan, the time from leaf expansion to shedding, exhibits wide variation and is a key integrator of relationships with photosynthetic rate, leaf mass per area (LMA), and leaf nitrogen among coexisting tropical tree species. We present a hierarchical view of sources of variation in leaf lifespan in tropical forests, emphasizing the importance of substantial within-species variation, which has rarely been addressed. Interspecific variation in leaf lifespan is positively correlated with LMA, varying from short-lived, low-LMA leaves to long-lived, high-LMA leaves of species associated with resource-rich versus resource-depleted habitats, respectively. Phenotypic responses of leaf lifespan and LMA to light show counter-gradient variation: with acclimation to shade, leaf lifespan increases, and LMA decreases, but both increase with adaptation to shade. In contrast, phenotypic responses to soil fertility are predicted to show co-gradient variation: both leaf lifespan and LMA increase with declining fertility both inter- and intraspecifically. We present new data analyses supporting these predictions, but the interactive effects of light and soil resources can produce complex phenotypic responses. Future studies of leaf lifespan should devote more attention to within-species variation to better quantify and explain how leaf lifespan is central to trade-offs generating the contrasting ecological strategies of tropical tree species.

abstract = {Abstract. The comparative phenotypic plasticity of 16 species of tropical rainforest shrubs (genus Psychotria, Rubiaceae) was investigated by growing plants in three light environments on Barro Colorado Island (BCI, Panama). The three light environments gave daily photon flux densities (PPFD) similar to the natural light gradient from shaded forest understory to small and large canopy gaps. Six of the species are principally found in gaps or forest edge environments, whereas the other ten species are principally found in shaded understories. Interactions between light treatment and species resulted in unpredictable mean phenotypic expression across light treatments. Shoot relative growth rates (RGR) were similar for understory and gap species in the low light treatment. Gap species had significantly greater shoot RGR in the intermediate light treatment than in the high light treatment. Mean plasticity was significantly lower for morphological variables when com- pared to physiological variables, while variation in plasticity was significantly greater for structural variables. Significant differences between gap and understory species were found in the plasticity of six out of the seven variables. The mean phenotypic plasticity of the seven variables was significantly greater for gap than for understory species. The high plasticity of gap species was consistent with the hypothesis that specialization in a more favorable environment increases plasticity. The species exhibited a wide range of leaf longevities, from four to 29 months, with gap species having, on average, shorter leaf life- span than understory species. Mean phenotypic plasticity decreased with increasing leaf longevity. Selection for greater plasticity may be stronger in the gap species because gaps exhibit a relatively predictable decrease in PPFD for which plasticity could be adaptive. While we have found a significant correlation between phenotypic plasticity and habitat affiliation, phylogeny (subgenus ascription) was not correlated with plasticity or with plant performance in any given PPFD treatment, reinforcing the hypothesis that phenotypic plas- ticity has evolved through natural selection in this diverse genus.},

@article{Moorad2017,
abstract = {The unusually long lifespans of humans and the persistence of post-reproductive lifespans in women represent evolutionary puzzles because natural selection cannot directly favour continued living in post-menopausal women or elderly men. Suggested sources of indirect selection require genetic correlations between fitness and survival or reproduction at younger ages, reproduction in the opposite sex, or late-life contributions to offspring or grandoffspring fitness. Here we apply quantitative genetic analyses to data from a historical human population to explicitly test these evolutionary genetic hypotheses. Total genetic selection increased the male post-50 lifespans by 0.138 years per generation; 94{\%} of this arose from indirect selection acting to favour early-life fitness in both sexes. These results argue strongly against life-history models of ageing that depend on trade-offs between reproduction and late-life survival. No source of indirect selection for female post-50 lifespan was detected, deepening the mystery of why female post-reproductive survival persists. This result is probably due to recent changes in the genetic architecture of female lifespan, and it highlights the need for similar quantitative genetic analyses of human populations at other points along demographic transitions. Using a historical dataset, Moorad and Walling investigate possible selection for post-reproductive lifespan in humans, finding indirect selection favouring early-life fitness in both sexes, but none in females over 50.},

abstract = {* Premise of the study: Continuous within-plant variation in quantitative traits of reiterated, homologous structures is a component of intraspecific variation, but its contribution to functional diversity remains largely unexplored. For the perennial Helleborus foetidus, we measured functional leaf traits to quantify the contribution of within-plant variation to intraspecific functional variance and evaluate whether within-plant variability itself deserves separate consideration. * Methods: Within-individual variation in eight leaf traits was quantified for 138 plants sampled from 10 widely spaced locations in the Sierra de Cazorla, southeastern Spain. An amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique was used to look for associations between within-plant variability and specific AFLP markers. * Key results: Leaflets from basal positions in ramets were longer, heavier, had greater surface area and larger stomata, and lower specific area, stomatal index, and stomatal density than those from distal positions. Continuous variation between leaves from the same ramet was the main source of population-wide variance for most traits. Within-plant variability differed among populations. Individuals differed in within-plant variability, which was largely independent of trait means and associated with genetic characteristics. Up to four AFLP markers were associated with the within-plant variability level of a given leaf trait. * Conclusions: Subindividual variability in continuous leaf traits was independent of plant means and related to genetic features. The within-individual component generally exceeded the between-individual component of intraspecific variance. Within-plant variation may broaden the ecological breadth and enhance stability and persistence of plant populations and communities and may provide novel insights when incorporated in trait-based community ecology models.},

SAM/BAM files usually contain information from tens to hundreds of millions of reads. Often, the sequencing technology, protocol and/or the selected mapping algorithm introduce some unwanted biases in these data. The systematic detection of such biases is a non-trivial task that is crucial to drive appropriate downstream analyses.Results: We have developed Qualimap, a Java application that supports user-friendly quality control of mapping data, by considering sequence features and their genomic properties.

abstract = {Tropical forests are converted at an alarming rate for agricultural use and pastureland, but also regrow naturally through secondary succession. For successful forest restoration, it is essential to understand the mechanisms of secondary succession. These mechanisms may vary across forest types, but analyses across broad spatial scales are lacking. Here, we analyse forest recovery using 1,403 plots that differ in age since agricultural abandonment from 50 sites across the Neotropics. We analyse changes in community composition using species-specific stem wood density (WD), which is a key trait for plant growth, survival and forest carbon storage. In wet forest, succession proceeds from low towards high community WD (acquisitive towards conservative trait values), in line with standard successional theory. However, in dry forest, succession proceeds from high towards low community WD (conservative towards acquisitive trait values), probably because high WD reflects drought tolerance in harsh early successional environments. Dry season intensity drives WD recovery by influencing the start and trajectory of succession, resulting in convergence of the community WD over time as vegetation cover builds up. These ecological insights can be used to improve species selection for reforestation. Reforestation species selected to establish a first protective canopy layer should, among other criteria, ideally have a similar WD to the early successional communities that dominate under the prevailing macroclimatic conditions.},

@article{Burivalova2014,
abstract = {Primary tropical forests are lost at an alarming rate, and much of the remaining forest is being degraded by selective logging [1-5]. Yet, the impacts of logging on biodiversity remain poorly understood, in part due to the seemingly conflicting findings of case studies: about as many studies have reported increases in biodiversity after selective logging as have reported decreases [2, 6-11]. Consequently, meta-analytical studies that treat selective logging as a uniform land use tend to conclude that logging has negligible effects on biodiversity [2, 6, 12]. However, selectively logged forests might not all be the same [2, 13-15]. Through a pantropical meta-analysis and using an information-theoretic approach, we compared and tested alternative hypotheses for key predictors of the richness of tropical forest fauna in logged forest. We found that the species richness of invertebrates, amphibians, and mammals decreases as logging intensity increases and that this effect varies with taxonomic group and continental location. In particular, mammals and amphibians would suffer a halving of species richness at logging intensities of 38 m3ha-1and 63 m3ha-1, respectively. Birds exhibit an opposing trend as their total species richness increases with logging intensity. An analysis of forest bird species, however, suggests that this pattern is largely due to an influx of habitat generalists into heavily logged areas while forest specialist species decline. Our study provides a quantitative analysis of the nuanced responses of species along a gradient of logging intensity, which could help inform evidence-based sustainable logging practices from the perspective of biodiversity conservation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

We describe the necessary and sufficient conditions for testing these hypotheses, and show that attempts to evaluate them have been hampered by use of the inappropriate standard of regular spacing. Data describing the spacing dynamics of Dipteryx panamensis, a rain forest canopy tree, support both hypotheses. From 7 mo to 2 yr postgermination, seedling survival was positively correlated with distance to adult and negatively correlated with local conspecific seedling density. Partial correlation was used to separate the effects of density and distance, and it was shown that seedling density was the only significant factor in this case. Older juveniles and saplings occurred at greater distances from the nearest conspecific adult than did 1980 seedlings. No seedlings or juveniles survived within 8 m of an adult bole. A review of 24 data sets on tropical woody plants showed that most evidence indicates either density-dependence or distance-dependence in progeny mortality, as hypothesized by Janzen and Connell. Some positive evidence also exists for the minimum critical distance effect for tropical trees. In most of the cases involving seedling mortality, however, alternative causal factors such as intracohort competition or allelopathy were not ruled out. Before generalizations can be made about this process in tropical forests, carefully designed studies are needed on more populations of tropical trees.},

abstract = {The relationship between species diversity and sampled area is fundamental to ecology. Traditionally, theories of the species-area relationship have been dominated by random-placement models. Such models were used to formulate the canonical theory of species-area curves and species abundances. In this paper, however, armed with a detailed data set from a moist tropical forest, we investigate the validity of random placement and suggest improved models based upon spatial aggregation. By accounting for intraspecific, small-scale aggregation, we develop a cluster model which reproduces empirical species-area curves with high fidelity. We find that inter-specific aggregation patterns, on the other hand, do not affect the species-area curves significantly. We demonstrate that the tendency for a tree species to aggregate, as well as its average clump size, is not significantly correlated with the species' abundance. In addition, we investigate hierarchical clumping and the extent to which aggregation is driven by topography. We conclude that small-scale phenomena such as dispersal and gap recruitment determine individual tree placement more than adaptation to larger-scale topography. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Amazonian forests are extraordinarily diverse, but the estimated species richness is very much debated. Here, we apply an ensemble of parametric estimators and a novel technique that includes conspecific spatial aggregation to an extended database of forest plots with up-to-date taxonomy. We show that the species abundance distribution of Amazonia is best approximated by a logseries with aggregated individuals, where aggregation increases with rarity. By averaging several methods to estimate total richness, we confirm that over 15,000 tree species are expected to occur in Amazonia. We also show that using ten times the number of plots would result in an increase to just {\~{}}50{\%} of those 15,000 estimated species. To get a more complete sample of all tree species, rigorous field campaigns may be needed but the number of trees in Amazonia will remain an estimate for years to come.},

abstract = {1. Considerable debate surrounds the extent to which tropical forests can be managed for resource extraction while conserving biodiversity and ecosystem properties, which depend on functional composition. Here we evaluate the compatibility of these aims by examining the effects of logging on taxonomic and functional diversity and composition in a tropical forest. 2. Twenty years after selective logging, we inventoried 4140 stems regenerating in logging gaps and adjacent undisturbed areas, and we integrated a database of 13 functional traits describing leaf and wood economics of tropical trees. 3. We found no differences in taxonomic and functional richness among habitats, but logging gaps had significantly higher taxonomic and functional evenness. 4. Logging also effected striking, long-term changes in both species and functional composition. In particular, the xylem density of recruits in logging gaps was 6{\%} less than in unlogged forests, leaves were 11{\%}less tough and had 6–13{\%}greater mineral nutrient concentrations. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that managers of tropical forests should limit overall surface area converted to logging gaps by creating fewer, larger gaps during selective logging, to reduce impacts on the taxonomic and functional composition of the regenerating stand.},

abstract = {Community ecologists are active in describing species by their functional traits, quantifying the functional structure of plant and animal assemblages and inferring community assembly processes with null-model analyses of trait distribution and functional diversity indices. Intraspecific variation in traits and effects of spatial scale are potentially important in these analyses. Here, we introduce the R package cati (Community Assembly by Traits: Individuals and beyond) available on CRAN, for the analysis of community assembly with functional traits. cati builds on a recent approach to community assembly that explicitly incorporates individual differences in community assembly analyses and decomposes phenotypic variations across scales and organizational levels, based on three phenotypic variance ratios, termed the T-statistics. More generally, the cati package 1) calculates a variety of single-trait and multi-trait indices from interspecific and intraspecific trait measures; 2) it partitions functional trait variation among spatial and taxonomic levels; 3) it implements a palette of flexible null models for detecting non-random patterns of functional traits. These patterns can be used to draw inferences about hypotheses of community assembly such as environmental filtering and species interactions. The basic input for cati is a data frame in which columns are traits, rows are species or individuals, and entries are the measured trait values. The cati package can also incorporate a square distance matrix into analyses, which could include phylogenetic or genetic distances among individuals or species. Users select from a variety of functional trait metrics and analyze these relative to a null model that specifies trait distributions in a regional source pool.},

Here, we extend the adaptive landscape framework to ecological sorting of multidimensional phenotypes across environments and discuss how two analytical approaches can be used to quantify fitness as a function of the interaction between the phenotype and the environment. We encourage ecologists to consider how phenotypic integration will constrain species responses to environmental change.},

abstract = {The origin of species diversity has challenged biologists for over two centuries. Allopatric speciation, the divergence of species resulting from geographical isolation, is well documented. However, sympatric speciation, divergence without geographical isolation, is highly controversial. Claims of sympatric speciation must demonstrate species sympatry, sister relationships, reproductive isolation, and that an earlier allopatric phase is highly unlikely. Here we provide clear support for sympatric speciation in a case study of two species of palm (Arecaceae) on an oceanic island. A large dated phylogenetic tree shows that the two species of Howea, endemic to the remote Lord Howe Island, are sister taxa and diverged from each other well after the island was formed 6.9 million years ago. During fieldwork, we found a substantial disjunction in flowering time that is correlated with soil preference. In addition, a genome scan indicates that few genetic loci are more divergent between the two species than expected under neutrality, a finding consistent with models of sympatric speciation involving disruptive/divergent selection. This case study of sympatric speciation in plants provides an opportunity for refining theoretical models on the origin of species, and new impetus for exploring putative plant and animal examples on oceanic islands.},

abstract = {Species diversity of vascular epiphyte plant communities was studied in La Carbonera, a montane rain forest dominated by Podocarpaceae in the Venezuelan Andes. We compared the epiphyte communities of the primary, disturbed, and secondary forest areas of La Carbonera in order to augment the scarce knowledge on the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on these important elements of tropical vegetation. Diversity of vascular epiphytes (191 species in the whole forest area) was low in the disturbed and secondary areas (81 spp.) compared to adjacent primary forest (178 spp.). Four types of disturbed forest and secondary vegetation supported different numbers of epiphyte species, showing a decline with increasing degrees of disturbance (65 spp. along a road transect, 42 spp. on relict trees in disturbed forest, 13 spp. in a tree plantation and 7 spp. in a former clearing, both secondary vegetation units). Epiphytic species composition in primary and disturbed or secondary forest areas differed markedly: disturbed habitats harboured fewer fern and orchid species but more bromeliad species than the primary forest. Probably the families occurring only in primary forest sites of our study may be useful as bioindicators to determine the degree of disturbance in other habitats of mountain rain forests as well. Epiphyte abundance was also lower in disturbed habitats: a remnant emergent tree supported only about half as many epiphyte individuals as a member of the same species of similar size in the primary forest. The decrease in species numbers and abundance as well as the differences in species composition are mainly due to the less diverse phorophyte structure and less differentiated microclimate in the disturbed and secondary vegetation compared to the primary forest.},

abstract = {Where conspecific seedlings occur at high densities, density-dependent processes tend to depress their performance and survival relative to co-occurring heterospecifics. We extend this observation to within-species genetic diversity and relatedness. We posit that seedling growth and survival increase where there is higher genetic diversity, and lower relatedness, among seedling populations, under the expectation that increased genetic dissimilarity among conspecific seedlings affords greater resistance to pathogens. We used estimates of individual seedling genetic diversity (multilocus heterozygosity (sMLH)) and genetic relatedness among conspecific seedlings (pairwise kinship coefficients (LRI)), under high and low conspecific seedling density, coupled with censuses of seedling growth and mortality over 30 months to explore the role of genetic diversity and relatedness on growth and mortality of 1,485 seedlings of four dipterocarp species in an undisturbed Bornean tropical rainforest. We hypothesized that more genetically diverse and less related co-occurring seedlings would display higher survival and growth rates. In three of our four species, lower genetic diversity increased the probability of mortality over 30 months. We observed no effect of genetic diversity on relative growth rates. Contrary to our expectations, only one species showed a negative effect of increased relatedness on mortality. In two of the four species studied, seedlings that were more genetically related to neighbouring conspecific seedlings in the sample plot were less likely to die, but grew more slowly. Synthesis. Our results confirm that genetic diversity and relatedness among seedlings shape survival probabilities differentially across species. In contrast, we found no differences in mortality and growth rates between plots with low and high seedling density. Our results suggest that a greater abundance of pollen donors could contribute to cohort seedling survival in some species, though not all, and the specific mechanisms by which genetic relatedness determines seedling demography remain uncertain. These results have conservation and management implications in view of changing patterns of gene flow in fragmented, exploited and degraded tropical rainforests, which might differentially influence natural regeneration among species.},

abstract = {Soil abiotic and biotic factors play key roles in plant community dynamics. However, little is known about how soil biota influence vegetation changes over time. Here, we show that the effects of soil organisms may depend on both the successional development of ecosystems and on the successional position of the plants involved. In model systems of plants and soils from different successional stages, we observed negative plant–soil feedback for early-successional plant species, neutral feedback for mid-successional species, and positive feedback for late-successional species. The negative feedback of early-successional plants was independent of soil origin, while late-successional plants performed best in late- and worst in early-successional soil. Increased performance of the subordinate, late-successional plants resulted in enhanced plant community diversity. Observed feedback effects were more related to soil biota than to abiotic conditions. Our results show that temporal variations in plant–soil interactions profoundly contribute to plant community assemblage and ecosystem development.},

abstract = {1. Niche theory proposes that species differences underlie both coexistence within communities and the differentiation in species composition among communities via limiting similarity and environmental filtering. However, it has been difficult to extend niche theory to species-rich communities because of the empirical challenge of quantifying niches for many species. This has motivated the development of functional and phylogeny-based approaches in community ecology, which represent two different means of approximating niche attributes. 2. Here, we assess the utility of plant functional traits and phylogenetic relationships in predicting community assembly processes using the largest trait and phylogenetic data base to date for any set of species-rich communities. 3. We measured 17 functional traits for all 4672 individuals of 668 tree species co-occurring in nine tropical rain forest plots in French Guiana. Trait variation was summarized into two ordination axes that reflect species niche overlap. 4. We also generated a dated molecular phylogenetic tree based on DNA sequencing of two plastid loci (rbcL and matK) comprising 97{\%} of the individuals and 91{\%} of the species in the plots. 5. We found that, on average, co-occurring species had greater functional and, to a lesser extent, phylogenetic similarity than expected by chance. 6. We also found that functional traits and their ordination loadings showed significant, albeit weak, phylogenetic signal, suggesting that phylogenetic distance provides pertinent information on niche overlap in tropical tree communities. 7. Synthesis. We provide the most comprehensive examination to date of the relative importance of environmental filtering and limiting similarity in structuring tropical tree communities. Our results confirm that environmental filtering is the overriding influence on community assembly in these species-rich systems.},

abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size e and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more efficiently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter e on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" samplers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Matthew D.

Variation in leaf traits among growth forms was more pronounced per area than per mass. Thirteen bivariate leaf trait relationships that describe how plants allocate resources to photosynthesis were significant across all species. Growth forms showed distinct slopes, intercepts or shifts in the common slope for 12 of the 13 relationships. * 3Trait relationships within trees and lianas showed good agreement with a global leaf trait data set. However, for understorey plants, trait relationships that included specific leaf area (SLA) deviated from the global data set, suggesting that understorey leaf-allocation patterns optimize SLA, and hence growth. * 4Lianas showed lower values and rates of gas exchange than trees, and longer leaf life span for a given SLA, illustrating variation in leaf traits associated with growth form and canopy geometry. * 5Functional variation in allocation to photosynthetic capacity among tropical forest species is related to microhabitat variations in light availability and whole-plant morphology among growth forms.},

abstract = {Although the existence of a large carbon sink in terrestrial ecosystems is well-established, the drivers of this sink remain uncertain. It has been suggested that perturbations to forest demography caused by past land-use change, management, and natural disturbances may be causing a large component of current carbon uptake. Here we use a global compilation of forest age observations, combined with a terrestrial biosphere model with explicit modeling of forest regrowth, to partition the global forest carbon sink between old-growth and regrowth stands over the period 1981-2010. For 2001-2010 we find a carbon sink of 0.85 (0.66-0.96) Pg year-1 located in intact old-growth forest, primarily in the moist tropics and boreal Siberia, and 1.30 (1.03-1.96) Pg year-1 located in stands regrowing after past disturbance. Approaching half of the sink in regrowth stands would have occurred from demographic changes alone, in the absence of other environmental changes. These age-constrained results show consistency with those simulated using an ensemble of demographically-enabled terrestrial biosphere models following an independent reconstruction of historical land use and management. We estimate that forests will accumulate an additional 69 (44-131) Pg C in live biomass from changes in demography alone if natural disturbances, wood harvest, and reforestation continue at rates comparable to those during 1981-2010. Our results confirm that it is not possible to understand the current global terrestrial carbon sink without accounting for the sizeable sink due to forest demography. They also imply that a large portion of the current terrestrial carbon sink is strictly transient in nature.},

abstract = {Key message: Genetic diversity appears to be unaffected by disturbance in a stand of the light-demanding Neotropical treeV. michelii. Although spatial genetic structure is modified in post-disturbance cohorts, mixing of seeds from different mother trees in canopy gaps appears to efficiently maintain genetic admixture. Context: The interplay between genetic and demographic processes has major consequences on population viability. Population size affects demographic trends, while genetic diversity insures viability by reducing risks of inbreeding depression and by maintaining adaptive potential. Yet, the consequences of increases in census size (as opposed to effective size) on genetic diversity of forest populations are poorly known. Aims: We have studied the structure of genetic diversity in populations of saplings of the light-responsive tree, Virola michelii (Myristicaceae, the nutmeg family), in two plots having undergone different levels of canopy-gap opening disturbance. This allowed us to test the “intermediate disturbance” hypothesis, which generally applies to species diversity, at the intra-specific scale. Methods: Levels and distribution of genetic diversity were compared between plots and between life stages. Sapling parentage was analysed to infer each adult tree's contribution to regeneration. Results: Genetic diversity was higher, and spatial genetic structure was stronger in the post-disturbance than in the control seedling population. Parentage analysis suggested that a limited number of parents contributed to most of the regeneration, but that efficient mixing of their progeny may have enhanced the diversity of saplings occupying canopy gaps. Conclusion: A mixture of demo-genetic processes may contribute to maintain genetic diversity in spite of, or possibly due to, ecosystem disturbance in V. michelii.},

abstract = {1. The relationship between species richness and ecosystem function, as measured by productivity or biomass, is of long-standing theoretical and practical interest in ecology. This is especially true for forests, which repre- sent a majority of global biomass, productivity and biodiversity. 2. Here, we conduct an analysis of relationships between tree species richness, biomass and productivity in 25 forest plots of area 8–50 ha from across the world. The data were collected using standardized protocols, obvi- ating the need to correct for methodological differences that plague many studies on this topic. 3. We found that at very small spatial grains (0.04 ha) species richness was generally positively related to pro- ductivity and biomass within plots, with a doubling of species richness corresponding to an average 48{\%} increase in productivity and 53{\%} increase in biomass. At larger spatial grains (0.25 ha, 1 ha), results were mixed, with negative relationships becoming more common. The results were qualitatively similar but much weaker when we controlled for stem density: at the 0.04 ha spatial grain, a doubling of species richness corre- sponded to a 5{\%} increase in productivity and 7{\%} increase in biomass. Productivity and biomass were them- selves almost always positively related at all spatial grains. 4. Synthesis. This is the first cross-site study of the effect of tree species richness on forest biomass and productiv- ity that systematically varies spatial grain within a controlled methodology. The scale-dependent results are consis- tent with theoretical models in which sampling effects and niche complementarity dominate at small scales, while environmental gradients drive patterns at large scales. Our study shows that the relationship of tree species richness with biomass and productivity changes qualitatively when moving from scales typical of forest surveys (0.04 ha) to slightly larger scales (0.25 and 1 ha). This needs to be recognized in forest conservation policy and management.},

To investigate this interaction, we developed models that could use LiDAR remote sensing to link leaf area profiles with tree size distributions, comparing models which did not (metabolic scaling theory) and did allow light to influence this link. We found that a light environment-to-structure link was necessary to accurately simulate tree size distributions and canopy structure in two contrasting Amazon forests. Partitioning leaf area profiles into size-class components, we found that demographic rates were related to variation in light absorption, with mortality increasing relative to growth in higher light, consistent with a light environment feedback to size distributions. Combining LiDAR with models linking forest structure and demography offers a high-throughput approach to advance theory and investigate climate-relevant tropical forest change.},

abstract = {Specific leaf area (SLA) is a key functional trait reflecting the trade-off between resource capture and conservation, and has been identified as playing an important role in plant community assembly. Mechanistic models of community assembly state that the assemblage of species in a local community is controlled by environment filters operating on functional traits. We measured within- and among-species variation of SLA, and environmental conditions in a tropical cloud forest to explore how variation in this functional trait contributes to community assembly. SLA variation at the species level was also decomposed into alpha (within assemblage variation), and beta (across assemblage variation) values. SLA decreased with increasing solar irradiance (approximated using plant height) within the three study sites, and differed among the three sites both for within- and among-species comparisons. Mean plot SLA, accounting for both within and among species across the three sites, increased significantly in relation to air temperature but not local photosynthetic photon flux density and soil total phosphorus. Alpha SLA decreased with increasing solar irradiance within the three sites and beta SLA differed among the three sites. Our results clearly demonstrate that light and air temperature are key environmental factors involved in organizing plant species within and among communities in tropical cloud forests. The strong relationship between both intra- and interspecific variation in SLA and environmental conditions strongly confirms the role of trait variation in the assembly of plant species in tropical cloud forest communities via environment filtering related to light availability and air temperature.},

Whereas some authors focus on the potential of hybridization as a source of genetic variation, functional novelty and new species, others argue against any important role, because reduced fitness would typically render hybrids an evolutionary dead end. By drawing on recent developments in the genetics and ecology of hybridization and on principles of ecological speciation theory, I develop a concept that reconciles these views and adds a new twist to this debate. Because hybridization is common when populations invade new environments and potentially elevates rates of response to selection, it predisposes colonizing populations to rapid adaptive diversification under disruptive or divergent selection. I discuss predictions and suggest tests of this hybrid swarm theory of adaptive radiation and review published molecular phylogenies of adaptive radiations in light of the theory.},

abstract = {One-third of all Neotropical forests are secondary forests that regrow naturally after agricultural use through secondary succession. We need to understand better how and why succession varies across environmental gradients and broad geographic scales. Here, we analyze functional recovery using community data on seven plant characteristics (traits) of 1,016 forest plots from 30 chronosequence sites across the Neotropics. By analyzing communities in terms of their traits, we enhance understanding of the mechanisms of succession, assess ecosystem recovery, and use these insights to propose successful forest restoration strategies. Wet and dry forests diverged markedly for several traits that increase growth rate in wet forests but come at the expense of reduced drought tolerance, delay, or avoidance, which is important in seasonally dry forests. Dry and wet forests showed different successional pathways for several traits. In dry forests, species turnover is driven by drought tolerance traits that are important early in succession and in wet forests by shade tolerance traits that are important later in succession. In both forests, deciduous and compound-leaved trees decreased with forest age, probably because microclimatic conditions became less hot and dry. Our results suggest that climatic water availability drives functional recovery by influencing the start and trajectory of succession, resulting in a convergence of community trait values with forest age when vegetation cover builds up.

abstract = {1. Efforts to understand the links between evolutionary and ecological dynamics hinge on our ability to measure and understand how genes influence phenotypes, fitness and population dynamics. Quantitative genetics provides a range of theoretical and empirical tools with which to achieve this when the relatedness between individuals within a population is known.2. A number of recent studies have used a type of mixed-effects model, known as the animal model, to estimate the genetic component of phenotypic variation using data collected in the field. Here, we provide a practical guide for ecologists interested in exploring the potential to apply this quantitative genetic method in their research.3. We begin by outlining, in simple terms, key concepts in quantitative genetics and how an animal model estimates relevant quantitative genetic parameters, such as heritabilities or genetic correlations.4. We then provide three detailed example tutorials, for implementation in a variety of software packages, for some basic applications of the animal model. We discuss several important statistical issues relating to best practice when fitting different kinds of mixed models.5. We conclude by briefly summarizing more complex applications of the animal model, and by highlighting key pitfalls and dangers for the researcher wanting to begin using quantitative genetic tools to address ecological and evolutionary questions.},

Both species were mainly found in valley sites on the island. Hence, these species shared the same topographic habitat niche. However, we found a clear difference between the spatial distributions of the two species in relation to the light environment. Neolistea aciculata was predominantly found in stands with low light, such as beneath the canopy of dense evergreen broadleaved forest. In contrast, N.sericea was predominantly associated with ample light, such as in secondary Pinus densiflora forest. In stands with moderate light conditions, both species were found. This habitat niche segregation in relation to light conditions presumably allows the coexistence of these two species in the predominantly successional forest on Miyajima Island. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Society for the Study of Species Biology.},

abstract = {The demand for projections of the future distribution of biodiversity has triggered an upsurge in modelling at the crossroads between ecology and evolution. Despite the enthusiasm around these so-called biodiversity models, most approaches are still criticised for not integrating key processes known to shape species ranges and community structure. Developing an integrative modelling framework for biodiversity distribution promises to improve the reliability of predictions and to give a better understanding of the eco-evolutionary dynamics of species and communities under changing environments. In this article, we briefly review some eco-evolutionary processes and interplays among them, which are essential to provide reliable projections of species distributions and community structure. We identify gaps in theory, quantitative knowledge and data availability hampering the development of an integrated modelling framework. We argue that model development relying on a strong theoretical foundation is essential to inspire new models, manage complexity and maintain tractability. We support our argument with an example of a novel integrated model for species distribution modelling, derived from metapopulation theory, which accounts for abiotic constraints, dispersal, biotic interactions and evolution under changing environmental conditions. We hope such a perspective will motivate exciting and novel research, and challenge others to improve on our proposed approach. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {There is substantial interest in uncovering the genetic bases of the traits underlying adaptive responses in tree species, as this information is central to understanding how evolution proceeds in such systems and will aid conservation and industrial endeavors. Here, we synthesize evidence for local adaptation in trees by summarizing 129 common garden experiments across 20 genera of tree species that describe levels of heritability, differentiation of quantitative genetic variation (QST), and/or QST-FST comparisons. Given the abundant evidence for local adaptation, we discuss theoretical expectations for adaptive genetic architectures and contextualize progress in trees by synthesizing 52 genotype-phenotype association studies across ten genera. Our survey suggests that most tree traits generally exhibit considerably high heritability (mean narrow sense heritability = 0.367, mean broad sense heritability = 0.430), that underlying genetic variation is often structured across populations (mean QST = 0.243) and is significantly greater than FST in 69{\%} of comparisons across the literature. Despite widespread evidence for local adaptation acting on abundant, heritable genetic variation, we find that single-locus associations explain only a small proportion of the phenotypic variation, often with small estimated per-locus effects (mean r-squared = 0.039). Together, these results suggest differential selection across populations often acts on tree phenotypes underlain by polygenic architectures consisting of numerous small to moderate effect loci. We close by addressing hurdles and promising alternatives to fully describing the underlying genetic architecture of quantitative traits in trees, remark upon the current state of tree genomics, and identify future directions for this field.},

abstract = {Environmental heterogeneity is regarded as one of the most important factors governing species richness gradients. An increase in available niche space, provision of refuges and opportunities for isolation and divergent adaptation are thought to enhance species coexistence, persistence and diversification. However, the extent and generality of positive heterogeneity–richness relationships are still debated. Apart from widespread evidence supporting positive relationships, negative and hump-shaped relationships have also been reported. In a meta-analysis of 1148 data points from 192 studies worldwide, we examine the strength and direction of the relationship between spatial environmental heterogeneity and species richness of terrestrial plants and animals. We find that separate effects of heterogeneity in land cover, vegetation, climate, soil and topography are significantly positive, with vegetation and topographic heterogeneity showing particularly strong associations with species richness. The use of equal-area study units, spatial grain and spatial extent emerge as key factors influencing the strength of heterogeneity–richness relationships, highlighting the pervasive influence of spatial scale in heterogeneity–richness studies. We provide the first quantitative support for the generality of positive heterogeneity–richness relationships across heterogeneity components, habitat types, taxa and spatial scales from landscape to global extents, and identify specific needs for future comparative heterogeneity–richness research.},

abstract = {Summary 1.Water availability is a key determinant of forest ecosystem function and tree species distributions. While droughts are increasing in frequency in many ecosystems, including in the tropics, plant responses to water supply vary with species and drought intensity, and are therefore difficult to model. Based on physiological first principles, we hypothesized that trees with a lower turgor loss point ($\pi$tlp), i.e., a more negative leaf water potential at wilting, would maintain water transport for longer into a dry season. 2.We measured sapflux density of 22 mature trees of 10 species during a dry season in an Amazonian rainforest, quantified sapflux decline as soil water content decreased, and tested its relationship to tree $\pi$tlp, size, and leaf predawn and midday water potentials measured after the onset of the dry season. 3.The measured trees varied strongly in the response of water use to the seasonal drought, with sapflux at the end of the dry season ranging from 37 to 117{\%} (on average 83 ± 5{\%}) of that at the beginning of the dry season. The decline of water transport as soil dried was correlated with tree $\pi$tlp (Spearman ?≥0.63), but not with tree size or predawn and midday water potentials. Thus, trees with more drought-tolerant leaves better maintained water transport during the seasonal drought. 4.1Our study provides an explicit correlation between a trait, measurable at the leaf level, and whole-plant performance under drying conditions. Physiological traits such as $\pi$tlp can be used to assess and model higher-scale processes in response to drying conditions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Trees reduce their allocation to apical growth compared with that to radial growth during later life stages. This has often been attributed to hydraulic and mechanical limitations; however, a growth–reproduction tradeoff might also play an important role. To test whether the height–diameter (H–D) relationship in trees changes with the timing of the onset of reproduction, we analyzed the H–D relationship of 13 deciduous broad-leaved tree species in a Japanese old-growth temperate forest using linear and segmented-linear regression models. These models showed a better fit than common continuous models (simple allometry and saturating curve). For 11 out of 13 species having break points on the H–D lines, we assessed whether the height at the breakpoint (BPH) was related to the height at the onset of reproduction determined by multiyear observatory records on several trees. Although BPH estimates for these 11 species were highly variable, most were within 3.1 m of the stable flowering height (staFLH), or the height at which trees achieve the ability to flower regardless of their growth conditions. The interspecies mean value of the difference between staFLH and BPH was only 45 cm, which suggested a causal relationship between these parameters. BPHs of nine out of 11 species were within the canopy layer and, for the two remaining species, were within the subcanopy layer. These results suggest that several species in this forest begin to reduce their allocation to apical growth around the canopy layer at the onset of stable reproduction.},

Stomatal conductance, the process that governs plant water use and carbon uptake, is fundamental to such models. In this paper, we reconcile two long-standing theories of stomatal conductance. The empirical approach, which is most commonly used in vegetation models, is phenomenological, based on experimental observations of stomatal behaviour in response to environmental conditions. The optimal approach is based on the theoretical argument that stomata should act to minimize the amount of water used per unit carbon gained. We reconcile these two approaches by showing that the theory of optimal stomatal conductance can be used to derive a model of stomatal conductance that is closely analogous to the empirical models. Consequently, we obtain a unified stomatal model which has a similar form to existing empirical models, but which now provides a theoretical interpretation for model parameter values. The key model parameter, g1, is predicted to increase with growth temperature and with the marginal water cost of carbon gain. The new model is fitted to a range of datasets ranging from tropical to boreal trees. The parameter g1 is shown to vary with growth temperature, as predicted, and also with plant functional type. The model is shown to correctly capture responses of stomatal conductance to changing atmospheric CO2, and thus can be used to test for stomatal acclimation to elevated CO2. The reconciliation of the optimal and empirical approaches to modelling stomatal conductance is important for global change biology because it provides a simple theoretical framework for analyzing, and simulating, the coupling between carbon and water cycles under environmental change.},

abstract = {Ecological responses to on-going climate change are numerous, diverse, and taxonomically widespread. However, with one exception, the relative roles of phenotypic plasticity and microevolution as mechanisms in explaining these responses are largely unknown. Several recent studies have uncovered evidence for temporal declines in mean body sizes of birds and mammals, and these responses have been interpreted as evidence for microevolution in the context of Bergmann's rule - an ecogeographic rule predicting an inverse correlation between temperature and mean body size in endothermic animals. We used a dataset of individually marked red-billed gulls (Larus novaehollandiae scopulinus) from New Zealand to document phenotypic and genetic changes in mean body mass over a 47-year (1958-2004) period. We found that, whereas the mean body mass had decreased over time as ambient temperatures increased, analyses of breeding values estimated with an "animal model" approach showed no evidence for any genetic change. These results indicate that the frequently observed climate-change-related responses in mean body size of animal populations might be due to phenotypic plasticity, rather than to genetic microevolutionary responses. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of 'variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms.

abstract = {Abstract The utility of plant functional traits for predictive ecology relies on our ability to interpret trait variation across multiple taxonomic and ecological scales. Using extensive data sets of trait variation within species, across species and across communities, we analysed whether and at what scales leaf economics spectrum (LES) traits show predicted trait?trait covariation. We found that most variation in LES traits is often, but not universally, at high taxonomic levels (between families or genera in a family). However, we found that trait covariation shows distinct taxonomic scale dependence, with some trait correlations showing opposite signs within vs. across species. LES traits responded independently to environmental gradients within species, with few shared environmental responses across traits or across scales. We conclude that, at small taxonomic scales, plasticity may obscure or reverse the broad evolutionary linkages between leaf traits, meaning that variation in LES traits cannot always be interpreted as differences in resource use strategy.},

abstract = {Plant functional traits directly affect ecosystem functions. At the species level, trait combinations depend on trade-offs representing different ecological strategies, but at the community level trait combinations are expected to be decoupled from these trade-offs because different strategies can facilitate co-existence within communities. A key question is to what extent community-level trait composition is globally filtered and how well it is related to global versus local environmental drivers. Here, we perform a global, plot-level analysis of trait–environment relationships, using a database with more than 1.1 million vegetation plots and 26,632 plant species with trait information. Although we found a strong filtering of 17 functional traits, similar climate and soil conditions support communities differing greatly in mean trait values. The two main community trait axes that capture half of the global trait variation (plant stature and resource acquisitiveness) reflect the trade-offs at the species level but are weakly associated with climate and soil conditions at the global scale. Similarly, within-plot trait variation does not vary systematically with macro-environment. Our results indicate that, at fine spatial grain, macro-environmental drivers are much less important for functional trait composition than has been assumed from floristic analyses restricted to co-occurrence in large grid cells. Instead, trait combinations seem to be predominantly filtered by local-scale factors such as disturbance, fine-scale soil conditions, niche partitioning and biotic interactions.},

We quantify tree vigor at the individual tree level, based on the difference between expected and observed growth. The available methods to join nonlinear tree growth and mortality processes are not commonly used by forest ecologists so that we develop an inference methodology based on an MCMC approach, allowing us to sample the parameters of the growth and mortality model according to their posterior distribution using the joint model likelihood. We apply our framework to a set of data on the 20-year dynamics of a forest in Paracou, French Guiana, taking advantage of functional trait-based growth and mortality models already developed independently. Our results showed that growth and mortality are intimately linked and that the vigor estimator is an essential predictor of mortality, highlighting that trees growing more than expected have a far lower probability of dying. Our joint model methodology is sufficiently generic to be used to join two longitudinal and punctual linked processes and thus may be applied to a wide range of growth and mortality models. In the context of global changes, such joint models are urgently needed in tropical forests to analyze, and then predict, the effects of the ongoing changes on the tree dynamics in hyperdiverse tropical forests.},

abstract = {Classic theory in plant-insect interactions has linked herbivore pressure with diversification in plant species. We hypothesize that herbivores may exert divergent selection on defences, such that closely related plant species will be more different in defensive than in non-defensive traits. We evaluated this hypothesis by investigating two clades of closely related plant species coexisting at a single site in the Peruvian Amazon: Inga capitata Desv. and Inga heterophylla Willd. species complexes. We compared how these lineages differ in the suite of chemical, biotic, phenological and developmental defences as compared to non-defensive traits that are related to habitat use and resource acquisition. We also collected insect herbivores feeding on the plants. Our data show that sister lineages within both species complexes are more divergent in antiherbivore defences than in other non-defensive, functional traits. Moreover, the assemblages of herbivore communities are dissimilar between the populations of coexisting I. capitata lineages. Synthesis. Our results are consistent with the idea that for the I. capitata and I. heterophylla species complexes, interactions with their natural enemies may have played a significant role in their phenotypic divergence and potentially in their diversification and coexistence. It also suggests that defensive traits are evolutionary labile.},

abstract = {This paper reviews how and when African rainforest diversity arose, presenting evidence from both plant and animal studies. Preliminary investigations show that these African forests are an assemblage of species of varying age. Phylogenetic evidence, from both African rainforest angiosperms and vertebrates, suggest a Tertiary origin for the major lineages in some of these groups. In groups where savannah species are well represented and rainforest species are a minority, the latter appear to be relics of a Mid-Tertiary rainforest. By contrast, species that are primarily adapted to rainforest have arisen in the past 10 Myr with the main morphological innovations dating from the Late Miocene, and Quaternary speciation dominating in large, morphologically homogeneous groups. The small number of species-level phylogenies for African rainforest plants hinders a more incisive and detailed study into the historical assembly of these continental forests.},

abstract = {The links between plant diversity and ecosystem functioning remain highly controversial. There is a growing consensus, however, that functional diversity, or the value and range of species traits, rather than species numbers per se, strongly determines ecosystem functioning. Despite its importance, and the fact that species diversity is often an inadequate surrogate, functional diversity has been studied in relatively few cases. Approaches based on species richness on the one hand, and on functional traits and types on the other, have been extremely productive in recent years, but attempts to connect their findings have been rare. Crossfertilization between these two approaches is a promising way of gaining mechanistic insight into the links between plant diversity and ecosystem processes and contributing to practical management for the conservation of diversity and ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Interspecific hybridization and genetic introgression are commonly observed in natural populations of many species, especially trees. Among oaks, gene flow between closely related species has been well documented. And yet, hybridization does not lead to a "melting pot", i.e., the homogenization of phenotypic traits. Here, we explore how the combination of several common reproductive and genomic traits could create an avenue for interspecific gene flow that partially explains this apparent paradox. During meiosis, F1 hybrids will produce approximately (1/2)n "reconstructed" parental gametes, where n equals the number of chromosomes. Crossing over would introduce a small amount of introgressive material. The resulting parental-type gametophytes would probably possess a similar fertilization advantage as conspecific pollen. The resulting "backcross" would actually be the genetic equivalent of a conspecific out-cross, with a small amount of heterospecific DNA captured through crossing over. Even with detailed genomic analysis, the resulting offspring would not appear to be a backcross. This avenue for rapid introgression between species through the F1 hybrid will be viable for organisms that meet certain conditions: low base chromosome number, conserved genomic structure and size, production of billions of gametes/gametophytes during each reproductive event, and conspecific fertilization advantage.},

abstract = {A common method of minimizing errors in large DNA sequence data sets is to drop variable sites with a minor allele frequency (MAF) below some specified threshold. Although widespread, this procedure has the potential to alter downstream population genetic inferences and has received relatively little rigorous analysis. Here we use simulations and an empirical single nucleotide polymorphism data set to demonstrate the impacts of MAF thresholds on inference of population structure—often the first step in analysis of population genomic data. We find that model-based inference of population structure is confounded when singletons are included in the alignment, and that both model-based and multivariate analyses infer less distinct clusters when more stringent MAF cutoffs are applied. We propose that this behaviour is caused by the combination of a drop in the total size of the data matrix and by correlations between allele frequencies and mutational age. We recommend a set of best practices for applying MAF filters in studies seeking to describe population structure with genomic data.},

abstract = {Aim Tropical forests account for a quarter of the global carbon storage and a third of the terrestrial productivity. Few studies have teased apart the relative importance of environmental factors and forest attributes for ecosystem functioning, especially for the tropics. This study aims to relate aboveground biomass (AGB) and biomass dynamics (i.e., net biomass productivity and its underlying demographic drivers: biomass recruitment, growth and mortality) to forest attributes (tree diversity, community-mean traits and stand basal area) and environmental conditions (water availability, soil fertility and disturbance). Location Neotropics. Methods We used data from 26 sites, 201 1-ha plots and {\textgreater}92,000 trees distributed across the Neotropics. We quantified for each site water availability and soil total exchangeable bases and for each plot three key community-weighted mean functional traits that are important for biomass stocks and productivity. We used structural equation models to test the hypothesis that all drivers have independent, positive effects on biomass stocks and dynamics. Results Of the relationships analysed, vegetation attributes were more frequently associated significantly with biomass stocks and dynamics than environmental conditions (in 67 vs. 33{\%} of the relationships). High climatic water availability increased biomass growth and stocks, light disturbance increased biomass growth, and soil bases had no effect. Rarefied tree species richness had consistent positive relationships with biomass stocks and dynamics, probably because of niche complementarity, but was not related to net biomass productivity. Community-mean traits were good predictors of biomass stocks and dynamics. Main conclusions Water availability has a strong positive effect on biomass stocks and growth, and a future predicted increase in (atmospheric) drought might, therefore, potentially reduce carbon storage. Forest attributes, including species diversity and community-weighted mean traits, have independent and important relationships with AGB stocks, dynamics and ecosystem functioning, not only in relatively simple temperate systems, but also in structurally complex hyper-diverse tropical forests.},

However, pedigrees are often unknown and must be inferred from genetic data. Despite the importance of pedigree inference, existing methods are limited to inferring only close relationships or analyzing a small number of individuals or loci. We present a simulated annealing method for estimating pedigrees in large samples of otherwise seemingly unrelated individuals using genome-wide SNP data. The method supports complex pedigree structures such as polygamous families, multi-generational families, and pedigrees in which many of the member individuals are missing. Computational speed is greatly enhanced by the use of a composite likelihood function which approximates the full likelihood. We validate our method on simulated data and show that it can infer distant relatives more accurately than existing methods. Furthermore, we illustrate the utility of the method on a sample of Greenlandic Inuit.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors. Global Change Biology Published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd. Most of the planet's diversity is concentrated in the tropics, which includes many regions undergoing rapid climate change. Yet, while climate-induced biodiversity changes are widely documented elsewhere, few studies have addressed this issue for lowland tropical ecosystems. Here we investigate whether the floristic and functional composition of intact lowland Amazonian forests have been changing by evaluating records from 106 long-term inventory plots spanning 30 years. We analyse three traits that have been hypothesized to respond to different environmental drivers (increase in moisture stress and atmospheric CO2 concentrations): maximum tree size, biogeographic water-deficit affiliation and wood density. Tree communities have become increasingly dominated by large-statured taxa, but to date there has been no detectable change in mean wood density or water deficit affiliation at the community level, despite most forest plots having experienced an intensification of the dry season. However, among newly recruited trees, dry-affiliated genera have become more abundant, while the mortality of wet-affiliated genera has increased in those plots where the dry season has intensified most. Thus, a slow shift to a more dry-affiliated Amazonia is underway, with changes in compositional dynamics (recruits and mortality) consistent with climate-change drivers, but yet to significantly impact whole-community composition. The Amazon observational record suggests that the increase in atmospheric CO2 is driving a shift within tree communities to large-statured species and that climate changes to date will impact forest composition, but long generation times of tropical trees mean that biodiversity change is lagging behind climate change.},

abstract = {Available experimental evidence suggests that there are genetic differences in the abilities of trees to compete for resources, in addition to non-genetic differences due to micro-site variation. The use of indirect genetic effects within the framework of linear mixed model methodology has been proposed for estimating genetic parameters and responses to selection in the presence of genetic competition. In this context, an individual's total breeding value reflects the effects of its direct breeding value on its own phenotype and its competitive breeding value on the phenotype of its neighbours. The present study used simulated data to investigate the relevance of accounting for competitive effects at the genetic and non-genetic levels in terms of the estimation of (co)variance components and selection response. Different experimental designs that resulted in different genetic relatedness levels within a neighbourhood and survival were other key issues examined. Variances estimated for additive genetic and residual effects tended to be biased under models that ignored genetic competition. Models that fitted competition at the genetic level only also resulted in biased (co)variance estimates for direct additive, competitive additive and residual effects. The ability to detect the correct model was reduced when relatedness within a neighbourhood was very low and survival decreased. Selection responses changed considerably between selecting on breeding value estimates from a model ignoring genetic competition and total breeding estimates using the correct model. Our results suggest that considering a genetic basis to competitive ability will be important to optimise selection programmes for genetic improvement of tree species. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

We apply the method to 28 complex traits in the UK Biobank data (N = 126,752) and show that on average, 6{\%} of SNPs have nonzero effects, which in total explain 22{\%} of phenotypic variance. We detect significant (P {\textless} 0.05/28) signatures of natural selection in the genetic architecture of 23 traits, including reproductive, cardiovascular, and anthropometric traits, as well as educational attainment. The significant estimates of the relationship between effect size and minor allele frequency in complex traits are consistent with a model of negative (or purifying) selection, as confirmed by forward simulation.

To address this deficiency, we partitioned the variance in two key functional traits (leaf mass area and leaf dry matter content) across six nested ecological scales (site, plot, species, tree, strata and leaf) in lowland tropical rainforests. In both traits, the plot level shows virtually no variance despite high species turnover among plots and the size of within-species variation (leaf + strata + tree) is comparable with that of species level variation. The lack of variance at the plot level brings substantial support to the idea that trait-based environmental filtering plays a central role in plant community assembly. These results and the finding that the amount of within-species variation is comparable with interspecific variation support a shift of focus from species-based to trait-based ecology.},

abstract = {Wood structure differs widely among tree species and species with faster growth, higher mortality and larger maximum size have been reported to have fewer but larger vessels and higher hydraulic conductivity (Kh). However, previous studies compiled data from various sources, often failed to control tree size and rarely controlled variation in other traits. We measured wood density, tree size and vessel traits for 325 species from a wet forest in Panama, and compared wood and leaf traits to demographic traits using species-level data and phylogenetically independent contrasts. Wood traits showed strong phylogenetic signal whereas pairwise relationships between traits were mostly phylogenetically independent. Trees with larger vessels had a lower fraction of the cross-sectional area occupied by vessel lumina, suggesting that the hydraulic efficiency of large vessels permits trees to dedicate a larger proportion of the wood to functions other than water transport. Vessel traits were more strongly correlated with the size of individual trees than with maxi- mal size of a species. When individual tree size was included in models, Kh scaled positively with maximal size and was the best predictor for both diameter and biomass growth rates, but was unrelated to mortality.},

The criteria determining local coexistence in close relatives have typically been, for ecologists, whether these species meet conditions of stable coexistence when competing for resources; in contrast, evolutionists often consider coexistence of close relatives from the perspective of complete reproductive isolation. Clearly, both of these conditions must be met, but for coexistence in ecologically and phenotypically similar close relatives to occur, species must overcome a diverse suite of challenges beyond just these. The goal of this review is to present a more holistic, eco-evolutionary view of the factors governing successful coexistence of close relatives, expanding our consideration to recent clade mates, not just sister taxa, and drawing on new technologies and approaches to explore more deeply this classic conundrum.

abstract = {animal physiological performance is highly polygenic and highly plastic, and the same is generally true for the many subordinate traits that underlie performance capacities. Quantitative genetics, therefore, provides an appropriate framework for the analysis of physiological phenotypes and can be used to infer the microevolutionary processes that have shaped patterns of trait variation within and among species. In cases where specific genes are known to contribute to variation in physiological traits, analyses of intraspecific polymorphism and interspecific divergence can reveal molecular mechanisms of functional evolution and can provide insights into the possible adaptive significance of observed sequence changes. In this review, we explain how the tools and theory of quantitative genetics, population genetics, and molecular evolution can inform our understanding of mechanism and process in physiological evolution. For example, lab-based studies of polygenic inheritance can be integrated with field-based studies of trait variation and survivorship to measure selection in the wild, thereby providing direct insights into the adaptive significance of physiological variation. Analyses of quantitative genetic variation in selection experiments can be used to probe interrelationships among traits and the genetic basis of physiological trade-offs and constraints. We review approaches for characterizing the genetic architecture of physiological traits, including linkage mapping and association mapping, and systems approaches for dissecting interme-diary steps in the chain of causation between genotype and phenotype. We also discuss the promise and limitations of population genomic approaches for inferring adaptation at specific loci. We end by highlighting the role of organismal physi-ology in the functional synthesis of evolutionary biology. complex traits; physiological genomics; QTL mapping; selection experiments; systems genetics WITHIN-SPECIES VARIATION IN whole animal physiological perfor-mance is typically attributable to the combined effects of allelic variation at many loci and environmentally induced variation occurring across all stages of development and even prior to conception. That is, physiological performance can generally be regarded as a classic quantitative trait. The same is generally true for the many subordinate traits that underlie whole animal performance capacities. For example, aerobic exercise perfor-mance in rodents is a function of the pulmonary, cardiovascu-lar, muscular, and neural systems, each of which comprises numerous components. For these reasons, quantitative genetics is well suited to the analysis of physiological phenotypes and can be used to infer the microevolutionary processes that have shaped patterns of trait variation within and among species. In cases where it is possible to identify allelic polymor-phisms at specific loci that contribute to variation in phys-iological traits, the tools and theory of population genetics can provide insights into the evolutionary processes that have shaped observed patterns of genetic variation within species (48, 185). In comparisons of homologous genes among species, analysis of sequence divergence and recon-struction of ancestral sequences permit inferences about historical pathways of molecular evolution (46). Moreover, ancestral sequence reconstructions provide a starting point for genetic engineering experiments that can provide de-tailed insights into the biochemical and biophysical mech-anisms that are responsible for evolved changes in molec-ular function (76, 77). Here, we review how genetic approaches can inform our understanding of mechanisms and processes in physiological evolution. We also review approaches for identifying genetic loci that contribute to variation in physiological traits, includ-ing both forward and reverse genetics approaches. We do not discuss evolutionary analyses in general, such as the use of phylogenetic comparative methods or ancestral state recon-structions of phenotypes (63, 121, 154); instead, we focus more specifically on how the tools and theory of quantitative genet-ics, population genetics, and molecular evolution can be used to shed light on the evolution of physiological and biochemical phenotypes.

@article{Loreau2000,
abstract = {The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has emerged as a major scientific issue today. As experiments progress, there is a growing need for adequate theories and models to provide robust interpretations and generalisations of experimental results, and to formulate new hypotheses. This paper provides an overview of recent theoretical advances that have been made on the two major questions in this area: (1) How does biodiversity affect the magnitude of ecosystem processes (short-term effects of biodiversity)? (2) How does biodiversity contribute to the stability and maintenance of ecosystem processes in the face of perturbations (long-term effects of biodiversity)? Positive short-term effects of species diversity on ecosystem processes, such as primary productivity and nutrient retention, have been explained by two major types of mechanisms: (1) functional niche complementarity (the complementarity effect), and (2) selection of extreme trait values (the selection effect). In both cases, biodiversity provides a range of phenotypic trait variation. In the complementarity effect, trait variation then forms the basis for a permanent association of species that enhances collective performance. In the selection effect, trait variation comes into play only as an initial condition, and a selective process then promotes dominance by species with extreme trait values. Major differences between within-site effects of biodiversity and across-site productivity-diversity patterns have also been clarified. The local effects of diversity on ecosystem processes are expected to be masked by the effects of varying environmental parameters in across-site comparisons. A major reappraisal of the paradigm that has dominated during the last decades seems necessary if we are to account for long-term effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning. The classical deterministic, equilibrium approaches to stability do not explain the reduced temporal variability of aggregate ecosystem properties that has been observed in more diverse systems. On the other hand, stochastic, nonequilibrium approaches do show two types of biodiversity effects on ecosystem productivity in a fluctuating environment: (1) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal variance; and (2) a performance-enhancing effect, i.e., an increase in the temporal mean. The basic mechanisms involved in these long-term insurance effects are very similar to those that operate in short-term biodiversity effects: temporal niche complementarity, and selection of extreme trait values. The ability of species diversity to provide an insurance against environmental fluctuations and a reservoir of variation allowing adaptation to changing conditions may be critical in a long-term perspective. These recent theoretical developments in the area of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning suggest that linking community and ecosystem ecology is a fruitful avenue, which paves the way for a new ecological synthesis.},

Most of these production forests have been or will be selectively harvested for commercial timber, but recent studies show that even soon after logging, harvested stands retain much of their tree-biomass carbon and biodiversity [2,3]. Comparing species richness of various animal taxa among logged and unlogged forests across the tropics, Burivalova et al.[4] found that despite some variability among taxa, biodiversity loss was generally explained by logging intensity (the number of trees extracted). Here, we use a network of 79 permanent sample plots (376 ha total) located at 10 sites across the Amazon Basin [5] to assess the main drivers of time-to-recovery of post-logging tree carbon (Table S1). Recovery time is of direct relevance to policies governing management practices (i.e., allowable volumes cut and cutting cycle lengths), and indirectly to forest-based climate change mitigation interventions.},

@article{Read2016,
abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated that the presence or abundance of specific genotypes, populations, species and phylogenetic clades may influence community and ecosystem properties such as resilience or productivity. Many ecological studies, however, use simple linear models to test for such relationships, including species identity as the predictor variable and some measured trait or function as the response variable without accounting for the nestedness of genetic variation across levels of organization. This omission may lead to incorrect inference about which source of variation influences community and ecosystem properties. Here, we explicitly compare this common approach to alternative ways of modeling variation in trait data, using simulated trait data and empirical results of common-garden trials using multiple levels of genetic variation within Eucalyptus, Populus and Picea. We show that: 1) when nested variation is ignored, an incorrect conclusion of species effect is drawn in up to 20{\%} of cases; 2) overestimation of the species effect increases – up to 60{\%} in some scenarios – as the nested term explains more of the variation; and 3) the sample sizes needed to overcome these potential problems associated with aggregating nested hierarchical variation may be impractically large. In common-garden trials, incorporating nested models increased explanatory power twofold for mammal browsing rate in Eucalyptus, threefold for leaf area in Populus, and tenfold for branch number in Picea. Thoroughly measuring intraspecific variation and characterizing hierarchical genetic variation beyond the species level has implications for developing more robust theory in community ecology, managing invaded natural systems, and improving inference in biodiversity–ecosystem functioning research. Synthesis Until recently, ecologists acknowledged the ubiquity of within-species trait variation, but paid scant attention to how much it affects communities and ecosystems. Here, the authors used simulated trait data and common-garden studies to demonstrate that we ignore intraspecific trait variation at our peril. In both simulated and experimental systems, in many cases ignoring intraspecific variation led to incorrect statistical inferences and inflated the effect size of species identity. This study shows that ecologists must characterize hierarchically nested genetic and phenotypic variation to fully understand the links between individual traits, community structure and ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {A theoretical model is developed of the fate of mutations for organisms with such life-history characteristics as indeterminate growth and clonal reproduction. It focuses on how the fate of a particular mutant depends on whether it arises during mitotic cell division (somatic mutation) or during meiotic cell division (meiotic mutation). At gamete production, individuals carrying somatic mutations will produce some proportion of gametes reflecting the original, zygotic genotype and some proportion reflecting genotypes carrying the somatic mutation. Focusing on allele frequencies at gamete production allows the effects of growth and clonal reproduction to be summarized. The relative strengths of somatic and meiotic mutation can be determined, as well as the conditions under which the change in allele frequency due to one is greater than that due to the other. Examples from a published demographic study of clonal corals are used to compare somatic and meiotic mutation. When there is no selection acting on either type of mutation, only a few cell divisions per time unit on average are needed for the change in allele frequency due to somatic mutation to be greater, given empirically based mutation rates. When somatic selection is added, the most dramatic effect is seen with fairly strong negative selection acting against the somatic mutation within individuals. In this case, selection within organisms can effectively counteract the effects of somatic mutation, and the change in allele frequency due to somatic mutations will not be greater than that due to meiotic mutations for reasonable numbers of within-generation cell divisions. The majority of the mutation load, which would have been due to somatic mutation, is purged by selection within the individual organism. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

All Scaphium species showed clear clump distribution in the plot, and their distribution was associated with topography. The index of spatial association supports the existence of strong habitat segregation among the three Scaphium species in a small spatial scale (smaller than ca. 1250 m2), and between S. borneense and S. longipetiolatum in a large spatial scale (larger than 2.5 ha). S. borneense and S. macropodum mainly occurred in sites higher than and lower than 180 m in altitude in the plot, respectively. S. longipetiolatum was completely restricted to sites lower than 140 m in altitude. The differences in height within plot correlated with soil texture and water conditions. The lower part of the plot had clayish and wet soil. The higher part was covered by sandy and dry soil. We can thus conclude that the sympatric Scaphium species have divergent habitats and coexisted by segregating their habitats with respect to topography and/or soil.},

abstract = {In fire-prone ecosystems, many plants possess traits that enhance their relative flammability and ecologists have suggested increased flammability could result from natural selection. To date, theoretical models addressing the evolution of flammable characteristics assume that flammable plants realize some direct fitness advantage. In this paper, we explore the idea that enhanced flammability can increase in frequency in a population without any direct fitness benefit to the flammable type. In our model, flammability evolves due to an association between an allele that promotes flammability and alleles at unlinked loci that give high fitness. In analogy to genetic hitchhiking, in which a deleterious allele can invade due to a genetic linkage, we call this process "genetic niche-hiking," because the association results from localized niche construction. Specifically, flammable plants sacrifice themselves and their neighbors to produce local fire-cleared gaps (the constructed niche) in which their offspring are able to continually track an ever-changing environment. Niche-hiking requires that mating, dispersal and niche construction all occur locally (i.e. the population is spatially structured), such that offspring are likely to experience the niches their parents construct. Using a spatially-explicit lattice-based simulation, we find that increased flammability can evolve despite the "self-killing" cost of such a trait. Genetic niche-hiking may also be applicable to the evolution of other traits in spatially structured ecological systems such as plant disease susceptibility and forest tree characteristics that influence gap production.},

abstract = {With the desire to model population genetic processes under increasingly realistic scenarios, forward genetic simulations have become a critical part of the toolbox of modern evolutionary biology. The SLiM forward genetic simulation framework is one of the most powerful and widely used tools in this area. However, its foundation in the Wright-Fisher model has been found to pose an obstacle to implementing many types of models; it is difficult to adapt the Wright-Fisher model, with its many assumptions, to modeling ecologically realistic scenarios such as explicit space, overlapping generations, individual variation in reproduction, density-dependent population regulation, individual variation in dispersal or migration, local extinction and recolonization, mating between subpopulations, age structure, fitness-based survival and hard selection, emergent sex ratios, and so forth. In response to this need, we here introduce SLiM 3, which contains two key advancements aimed at abolishing these limitations. First, the new non-Wright-Fisher or "nonWF" model type provides a much more flexible foundation that allows the easy implementation of all of the above scenarios and many more. Second, SLiM 3 adds support for continuous space, including spatial interactions and spatial maps of environmental variables. We provide a conceptual overview of these new features, and present several example models to illustrate their use.},

We contend that the growth of the hybrid subpopulation is the key to rare species assimilation, and we show how the production of hybrid seed, the fitness of hybrids, and pest pressure affect hybrid proliferation. We also discuss how habitat disturbance, unspecialized pollinators, and weak crossing barriers promote hybridization, and how the negative consequences of hybridization are unlikely to be compensated for by immigration from conspecific populations. We also illustrate stages in the demise of species in island floras. We suggest that hybridization is an increasing threat to rare species because ecological barriers are being disrupted by human activities.},

We extend these tissue-specific analyses of functional strategy towards a whole-plant approach by integrating data on functional traits for 13 448 leaves and wood tissues from 4672 trees representing 668 species of Neotropical trees. Strong correlations amongst traits previously defined as the leaf economics spectrum reflect a tradeoff between investments in productive leaves with rapid turnover vs. costly physical leaf structure with a long revenue stream. A second axis of variation, the ‘stem economics spectrum', defines a similar tradeoff at the stem level: dense wood vs. high wood water content and thick bark. Most importantly, these two axes are orthogonal, suggesting that tradeoffs operate independently at the leaf and at the stem levels. By simplifying the multivariate ecological strategies of tropical trees into positions along these two spectra, our results provide a basis to improve global vegetation models predicting responses of tropical forests to global change.},

abstract = {Mammal species have made the transition to the marine environment several times, and their lineages represent one of the classical examples of convergent evolution in morphological and physiological traits. Nevertheless, the genetic mechanisms of their phenotypic transition are poorly understood, and investigations into convergence at the molecular level have been inconclusive. While past studies have searched for convergent changes at specific amino acid sites, we propose an alternative strategy to identify those genes that experienced convergent changes in their selective pressures, visible as changes in evolutionary rate specifically in the marine lineages. We present evidence of widespread convergence at the gene level by identifying parallel shifts in evolutionary rate during three independent episodes of mammalian adaptation to the marine environment. Hundreds of genes accelerated their evolutionary rates in all three marine mammal lineages during their transition to aquatic life. These marine-accelerated genes are highly enriched for pathways that control recognized functional adaptations in marine mammals, including muscle physiology, lipid-metabolism, sensory systems, and skin and connective tissue. The accelerations resulted from both adaptive evolution as seen in skin and lung genes, and loss of function as in gustatory and olfactory genes. In regard to sensory systems, this finding provides further evidence that reduced senses of taste and smell are ubiquitous in marine mammals. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of identifying genes underlying convergent organism-level characteristics on a genome-wide scale and without prior knowledge of adaptations, and provides a powerful approach for investigating the physiological functions of mammalian genes.},

Results demonstrate that niche and neutrality form ends of a continuum from competitive to stochastic exclusion. In the absence of immigration, competitive exclusion tends to create a regular spacing of niches. However, immigration prevents the establishment of a limiting similarity. The equilibrium community consists of a set of complementary and redundant species, with their abundance determined, respectively, by the distribution of environmental conditions and the amount of immigration. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

We present quantitative estimates of beta-diversity for tropical trees by comparing species composition of plots in lowland terra firme forest in Panama, Ecuador, and Peru. We compare observations with predictions derived from a neutral model in which habitat is uniform and only dispersal and speciation influence species turnover. We find that beta-diversity is higher in Panama than in western Amazonia and that patterns in both areas are inconsistent with the neutral model. In Panama, habitat variation appears to increase species turnover relative to Amazonia, where unexpectedly low turnover over great distances suggests that population densities of some species are bounded by as yet unidentified processes. At intermediate scales in both regions, observations can be matched by theory, suggesting that dispersal limitation, with speciation, influences species turnover.},

Until recently, pedigrees were the gold standard to infer kinship, but the advent of next-generation sequencing and the availability of dense genetic markers in many species make it a good time to (re)evaluate the usefulness of genetic markers in this context. Using three published data sets where both pedigrees and markers are available, we evaluate two common and a new genetic estimator of kinship. We show discrepancies between pedigree values and marker estimates of kinship and explore via simulations the possible reasons for these. We find these discrepancies are attributable to two main sources: pedigree errors and heterogeneity in the origin of founders. We also show that our new marker-based kinship estimator has very good statistical properties and behaviour and is particularly well suited for situations where the source population is of small size, as will often be the case in conservation biology, and where high levels of kinship are expected, as is typical in social evolution studies.},

abstract = {As Earth is currently experiencing dramatic climate change, it is of critical interest to understand how species will respond to it. The chance of a species withstanding climate change is likely to depend on the diversity within the species and, particularly, whether there are sub-populations that are already adapted to extreme environments. However, most predictive studies ignore that species comprise genetically diverse individuals. We have identified genetic variants in Arabidopsis thaliana that are associated with survival of an extreme drought event - a major consequence of global warming. Subsequently, we determined how these variants are distributed across the native range of the species. Genetic alleles conferring higher drought survival showed signatures of polygenic adaptation and were more frequently found in Mediterranean and Scandinavian regions. Using geo-environmental models, we predicted that Central European, but not Mediterranean, populations might lag behind in adaptation by the end of the twenty-first century. Further analyses showed that a population decline could nevertheless be compensated by natural selection acting efficiently over standing variation or by migration of adapted individuals from populations at the margins of the species' distribution. These findings highlight the importance of within-species genetic heterogeneity in facilitating an evolutionary response to a changing climate.},

Of the eight plant DNA markers we tested (rbcLa, rpoC1, rpoB, matK, ycf5, trnL, psbA-trnH, ITS), matK and ITS had a low rate of sequencing success. More critically, none of the plastid markers achieved a rate of correct plant identification greater than 70{\%}, either alone or combined. The performance of all barcoding markers was noticeably low in few species-rich clades, such as the Laureae, and the Sapotaceae. A field test of the approach enabled us to detect 130 molecular operational taxonomic units in a sample of 252 juvenile trees. Including molecular markers increased the identification rate of juveniles from 72{\%} (morphology alone) to 96{\%} (morphology and molecular) of the individuals assigned to a known tree taxon.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that while DNA barcoding is an invaluable tool for detecting errors in identifications and for identifying plants at juvenile stages, its limited ability to identify collections will constrain the practical implementation of DNA-based tropical plant biodiversity programs.},

abstract = {An understanding of the drivers of tree growth at the species level is required to predict likely changes of carbon stocks and biodiversity when environmental conditions change. Especially in species-rich tropical forests, it is largely unknown how species differ in their response of growth to resource availability and individual size. We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to quantify the impact of light availability and tree diameter on growth of 274 woody species in a 50-ha long-term forest census plot in Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Light reaching each individual tree was estimated from yearly vertical censuses of canopy density. The hierarchical Bayesian approach allowed accounting for different sources of error, such as negative growth observations, and including rare species correctly weighted by their abundance. All species grew faster at higher light. Exponents of a power function relating growth to light were mostly between 0 and 1. This indicates that nearly all species exhibit a decelerating increase of growth with light. In contrast, estimated growth rates at standardized conditions (5 cm dbh, 5{\%} light) varied over a 9-fold range and reflect strong growth-strategy differentiation between the species. As a consequence, growth rankings of the species at low (2{\%}) and high light (20{\%}) were highly correlated. Rare species tended to grow faster and showed a greater sensitivity to light than abundant species. Overall, tree size was less important for growth than light and about half the species were predicted to grow faster in diameter when bigger or smaller, respectively. Together light availability and tree diameter only explained on average 12{\%} of the variation in growth rates. Thus, other factors such as soil characteristics, herbivory, or pathogens may contribute considerably to shaping tree growth in the tropics.},

abstract = {Biodiversity experiments have shown that species loss reduces ecosystem functioning in grassland. To test whether this result can be extrapolated to forests, the main contributors to terrestrial primary productivity, requires large-scale experiments. We manipulated tree species richness by planting more than 150,000 trees in plots with 1 to 16 species. Simulating multiple extinction scenarios, we found that richness strongly increased stand-level productivity. After 8 years, 16-species mixtures had accumulated over twice the amount of carbon found in average monocultures and similar amounts as those of two commercial monocultures. Species richness effects were strongly associated with functional and phylogenetic diversity. A shrub addition treatment reduced tree productivity, but this reduction was smaller at high shrub species richness. Our results encourage multispecies afforestation strategies to restore biodiversity and mitigate climate change.},

However, whether the trait co-ordination observed at the global scale occurs at other ecological scales (especially within species) remains an open question. Here, for sapling communities of two tropical dry forest types in Costa Rica, we show large differences amongst traits in the relative contribution of species turnover and intraspecific variation to their directional changes in response to environmental changes along a successional gradient. We studied the response of functional traits associated with the leaf economics spectrum and drought tolerance using intensive sampling to analyse inter- and intra-specific responses to environmental changes and ontogeny. Although the overall functional composition of the sapling communities changed during succession more through species turnover than through intraspecific trait variation, their relative contributions differed greatly amongst traits. For instance, community mean specific leaf area changed mostly due to intraspecific variation. Traits of the leaf economics spectrum showed decoupled responses to environmental drivers and ontogeny. These findings emphasise how divergent ecological mechanisms combine to cause great differences in changes of individual functional traits over environmental gradients and ecological scales.},

With a large number of predictors, one can find a reduced number of discriminant coordinate functions that are “optimal” for separating the groups. With two such functions, one can produce a classification map that partitions the reduced space into regions that are identified with group membership, and the decision boundaries are linear. This article is about richer nonlinear classification schemes. Linear discriminant analysis is equivalent to multiresponse linear regression using optimal scorings to represent the groups. In this paper, we obtain nonparametric versions of discriminant analysis by replacing linear regression by any nonparametric regression method. In this way, any multiresponse regression technique (such as MARS or neural networks) can be postprocessed to improve its classification performance.},

abstract = {Interactions between species can promote evolutionary divergence of ecological traits and social signals, a process widely assumed to generate species differences in adaptive radiation. However, an alternative view is that lineages typically interact when relatively old, by which time selection for divergence is weak and potentially exceeded by convergent selection acting on traits mediating interspecific competition. Few studies have tested these contrasting predictions across large radiations, or by controlling for evolutionary time. Thus the role of species interactions in driving broad-scale patterns of trait divergence is unclear. Here we use phylogenetic estimates of divergence times to show that increased trait differences among coexisting lineages of ovenbirds (Furnariidae) are explained by their greater evolutionary age in relation to non-interacting lineages, and that-when these temporal biases are accounted for-the only significant effect of coexistence is convergence in a social signal (song). Our results conflict with the conventional view that coexistence promotes trait divergence among co-occurring organisms at macroevolutionary scales, and instead provide evidence that species interactions can drive phenotypic convergence across entire radiations, a pattern generally concealed by biases in age. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Using a large new unpublished database, we examine the variability of specific leaf area and other leaf traits, the relationships between them, and their ability to predict position on the resource use axis. Specific leaf area is found to suffer from a number of drawbacks; it is both very variable between replicates and much influenced by leaf thickness. Leaf dry-matter content (sometimes referred to as tissue density) is much less variable, largely independent of leaf thickness and a better predictor of location on an axis of resource capture, usage and availability.

Our objectives were to evaluate relationships among hydraulic traits to identify strategies and test the ability of easy-to-measure traits as proxies for hard-to-measure hydraulic traits. * Xylem efficiency was related to capacitance, sapwood water content and turgor loss point, and other drought avoidance traits, but not to xylem safety (P50). Wood density was correlated (r = −0.57 to −0.97) with sapwood pressure–volume traits, forming an axis of hydraulic strategy variation. * In contrast to drier sites where hydraulic safety plays a greater role, tropical trees in this humid tropical site varied along an axis with low wood density, high xylem efficiency and high capacitance at one end of the spectrum, and high wood density and low turgor loss point at the other.},

We found that (i) the strength of plant genetic effects can be quite high; however, the overall strength of genetic effects on most response variables declined as the levels of organization increased. (ii) Plant genetic effects varied such that introgression had a greater impact on individual phenotypes than extended effects on arthropods or microbes/fungi. By contrast, the greatest effects of genotypic diversity were on arthropods. (iii) Plant genetic effects were greater on above-ground versus below-ground processes, but there was no difference between terrestrial and aquatic environments. (iv) The strength of the effects of intraspecific genotypic diversity tended to be weaker than interspecific genetic introgression. (v) Although genetic effects generally decline across levels of organization, in some cases they do not, suggesting that specific organisms and/or processes may respond more than others to underlying genetic variation.

abstract = {Aim To assess the effect of local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity on the potential distribution of species under future climate changes. Trees may be adapted to specific climatic conditions; however, species range predictions have classically been assessed by species distribution models (SDMs) that do not account for intra-specific genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity, because SDMs rely on the assumption that species respond homogeneously to climate change across their range, i.e. a species is equally adapted throughout its range, and all species are equally plastic. These assumptions could cause SDMs to exaggerate or underestimate species at risk under future climate change. Location The Iberian Peninsula. Methods Species distributions are predicted by integrating experimental data and modelling techniques. We incorporate plasticity and local adaptation into a SDM by calibrating models of tree survivorship with adaptive traits in provenance trials. Phenotypic plasticity was incorporated by calibrating our model with a climatic index that provides a measure of the differences between sites and provenances. Results We present a new modelling approach that is easy to implement and makes use of existing tree provenance trials to predict species distribution models under global warming. Our results indicate that the incorporation of intra-population genetic diversity and phenotypic plasticity in SDMs significantly altered their outcome. In comparing species range predictions, the decrease in area occupancy under global warming conditions is smaller when considering our survival-adaptation model than that predicted by a 'classical SDM' calibrated with presence-absence data. These differences in survivorship are due to both local adaptation and plasticity. Differences due to the use of experimental data in the model calibration are also expressed in our results: we incorporate a null model that uses survival data from all provenances together. This model always predicts less reduction in area occupancy for both species than the SDM calibrated with presence-absence. Main conclusions We reaffirm the importance of considering adaptive traits when predicting species distributions and avoiding the use of occurrence data as a predictive variable. In light of these recommendations, we advise that existing predictions of future species distributions and their component populations must be reconsidered. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Abstract
Functional and phylogenetic diversity are increasingly quantified in various fields of ecology and conservation biology. The need to maintain diversity turnover among sites, so-called beta-diversity, has also been raised in theoretical and applied ecology. In this study, we propose the first comprehensive framework for the large-scale mapping of taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity and of their respective turnover. Using high-resolution data on the spatial distribution and abundance of birds at a country scale, we disentangled areas of mismatches and congruencies between biodiversity components. We further revealed unequal representation of each component in protected areas: functional diversity was significantly under-represented whereas taxonomic diversity was significantly over-represented in protected areas. Our results challenge the use of any one diversity component as a surrogate for other components and stress the need to adopt an integrative approach to biodiversity conservation.},

abstract = {In the South American temperate evergreen rainforest (Valdivian forest), invasive plants are mainly restricted to open sites, being rare in the shaded understory. This is consistent with the notion of closed-canopy forests as communities relatively resistant to plant invasions. However, alien plants able to develop shade tolerance could be a threat to this unique forest. Phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation are two mechanisms enhancing invasiveness. Phenotypic plasticity can promote local adaptation by facilitating the establishment and persistence of invasive species in novel environments. We investigated the role of these processes in the recent colonization of Valdivian forest understory by the perennial alien herb Prunella vulgaris from nearby populations in open sites. Using reciprocal transplants, we found local adaptation between populations. Field data showed that the shade environment selected for taller plants and greater specific leaf areas. We found population differentiation and within-population genetic variation in both mean values and reaction norms to light variation of several ecophysiological traits in common gardens from seeds collected in sun and shade populations. The colonization of the forest resulted in a reduction of plastic responses to light variation, which is consistent with the occurrence of genetic assimilation and suggests that P. vulgaris individuals adapted to the shade have reduced probabilities to return to open sites. All results taken together confirm the potential for rapid evolution of shade tolerance in P. vulgaris and suggest that this alien species may pose a threat to the native understory flora of Valdivian forest. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {* 1Analysing the phylogenetic structure of natural communities may illuminate the processes governing the assembly and coexistence of species in ecological communities.
* 2Unifying previous works, we present a statistical framework to quantify the phylogenetic structure of communities in terms of average divergence time between pairs of individuals or species, sampled from different sites. This framework allows an additive partitioning of the phylogenetic signal into alpha (within-site) and beta (among-site) components, and is closely linked to Simpson diversity. It unifies the treatment of intraspecific (genetic) and interspecific diversity, leading to the definition of differentiation coefficients among community samples (e.g. IST, PST) analogous to classical population genetics coefficients expressing differentiation among populations (e.g. FST, NST).
* 3Two coefficients which express community differentiation among sites from species identity (IST) or species phylogeny (PST) require abundance data (number of individuals per species per site), and estimators that are unbiased with respect to sample size are given. Another coefficient ($\Pi$ST) expresses the gain of the mean phylogenetic distance between species found in different sites compared with species found within sites, and requires only incidence data (presence/absence of each species in each site).
* 4We present tests based on phylogenetic tree randomizations to detect community phylogenetic clustering (PST {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} IST or $\Pi$ST {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 0) or phylogenetic overdispersion (PST {\{}{\textless}{\}} IST or $\Pi$ST {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0). In addition, we propose a novel approach to detect phylogenetic clustering or overdispersion in different clades or at different evolutionary time depths using partial randomizations.
* 5IST, PST or $\Pi$ST can also be used as distances between community samples and regressed on ecological or geographical distances, allowing us to investigate the factors responsible for the phylogenetic signal and the critical scales at which it appears.
* 6We illustrate the approach on forest tree communities in Equatorial Guinea, where a phylogenetic clustering signal was probably due to phylogenetically conserved adaptations to the elevation gradient and was mostly contributed to by ancient clade subdivisions.
* 7The approach presented should find applications for comparing quantitatively phylogenetic patterns of different communities, of similar communities in different regions or continents, or of populations (within species) vs. communities (among species).},

Tree diversity has persisted through previous episodes of rapid change, even global extinctions. Given the pace of current change, our management of extant diversity needs to facilitate and even enhance the natural ability of trees to adapt and diversify. Numerous processes contribute to this evolutionary flexibility, including introgression, a widespread yet under‐studied process. Reproductive networks, in which species remain distinct despite interspecific gene flow, are called syngameons, a concept largely inspired from work focusing on Quercus. Delineating and analyzing such species groups, empirically and theoretically, will provide insights into the nonadditive effects on evolution of numerous partially interfertile species exchanging genetic material episodically under changing environmental conditions. To conserve tree diversity, crossing experiments designed with an empirical and theoretical understanding of the constituent syngameon should be set up to assist diversification and adaptation in the Anthropocene. Our increasingly detailed knowledge of the oak genome and of oak interspecific and intraspecific phenotypic variation will improve our ability to sustain the diversity of this tree through an unpredictable and unprecedented future.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Independence between observations is a standard prerequisite of traditional statistical tests of association. This condition is, however, violated when autocorrelation is present within the data. In the case of variables that are regularly sampled in space (i.e. lattice data or images), such as those provided by remote-sensing or geographical databases, this problem is particularly acute. Because analytic derivation of the null probability distribution of the test statistic (e.g. Pearson's r) is not always possible when autocorrelation is present, we propose instead the use of a Monte Carlo simulation with surrogate data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The null hypothesis that two observed mapped variables are the result of independent pattern generating processes is tested here by generating sets of random image data while preserving the autocorrelation function of the original images. Surrogates are generated by matching the dual-tree complex wavelet spectra (and hence the autocorrelation functions) of white noise images with the spectra of the original images. The generated images can then be used to build the probability distribution function of any statistic of association under the null hypothesis. We demonstrate the validity of a statistical test of association based on these surrogates with both actual and synthetic data and compare it with a corrected parametric test and three existing methods that generate surrogates (randomization, random rotations and shifts, and iterative amplitude adjusted Fourier transform). Type I error control was excellent, even with strong and long-range autocorrelation, which is not the case for alternative methods.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The wavelet-based surrogates are particularly appropriate in cases where autocorrelation appears at all scales or is direction-dependent (anisotropy). We explore the potential of the method for association tests involving a lattice of binary data and discuss its potential for validation of species distribution models. An implementation of the method in Java for the generation of wavelet-based surrogates is available online as supporting material.},

However, little of this research has explored variation at microgeographic scales because it has often been assumed that high rates of gene flow will prevent adaptive divergence at fine spatial scales. Here, we establish a quantitative definition of microgeographic adaptation based on Wright's dispersal neighborhood that standardizes dispersal abilities, enabling this measure to be compared across species. We use this definition to evaluate growing evidence of evolutionary divergence at fine spatial scales. We identify the main mechanisms known to facilitate this adaptation and highlight illustrative examples of microgeographic evolution in nature.

It is thought that mast seeding is a rare reproductive strategy in the tropics, since tropical climates are less variable, and fruit consumers tend to be more generalist in these regions. However, previous tests of this hypothesis were based on only few tropical datasets, and none frorn tropical South America. Moreover, reproductive strategies have been quantified based on the coefficient of variation of interannual seed production, an index that potentially confounds masting and high interannual variability in seed production. Methodology/Principal Findings. We developed a new approach to model the monthly variability in seed production for 28 tree species, and 20 liana species monitored during 5 years in a tropical forest of Central French Guiana. We found that 23{\%} of the species showed a masting pattern, 54{\%} an annual fruiting pattern, and 23{\%} an irregular fruiting pattern. The majority of masting species were trees (8 out of 11), most of them animal-dispersed. The classification into reproductive strategies based on the coefficient of variation was inconsistent with our results in nearly half of the cases. Conclusions/Significance. Our study is the first to clearly evidence the frequency of the masting strategy in a tropical forest community of Eastern South America. The commonness of the masting strategy in tropical plants may promote species coexistence through storage dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2007 Norden et al.},

Commonly used methods to separate neutral effects from adaptive effects are based on locus-specific population differentiation coefficients to identify outliers. Here we extend such an approach to estimate directly the probability that each locus is subject to selection using a Bayesian method. We also extend it to allow the use of dominant markers like AFLPs. It has been shown that this model is robust to complex demographic scenarios for neutral genetic differentiation. Here we show that the inclusion of isolated populations that underwent a strong bottleneck can lead to a high rate of false positives. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to avoid them by carefully choosing the populations that should be included in the analysis. We analyze two previously published data sets: a human data set of codominant markers and a Littorina saxatilis data set of dominant markers.

Affected forest lost biomass, reversing a large long-term carbon sink, with the greatest impacts observed where the dry season was unusually intense. Relative to pre-2005 conditions, forest subjected to a 100-millimeter increase in water deficit lost 5.3 megagrams of aboveground biomass of carbon per hectare. The drought had a total biomass carbon impact of 1.2 to 1.6 petagrams (1.2 x 10(15) to 1.6 x 10(15) grams).

abstract = {The availability of recent state-of-the-art long-read sequencing technologies has significantly increased the ease and speed of producing high-quality plant genome assemblies. A wide variety of genome-related software tools are now available and they are typically benchmarked using microbial or model eukaryotic genomes such as Arabidopsis and rice. However, many plant species have much larger and more complex genomes than these, and the choice of tools, parameters, and/or strategies that can be used is not always obvious. Thus, we have compared the metrics of assemblies generated by various pipelines to discuss how assembly quality can be affected by two different assembly strategies. First, we focused on optimizing read preprocessing and assembler variables using eight different de novo assemblers on five different Pacific Biosciences long-read datasets of diploid and tetraploid species. Then, we examined a single scaffolding tool (quickmerge) that has been employed for the postprocessing step. We then merged the outputs from multiple assemblies to produce a higher quality consensus assembly. Then, we benchmarked the assemblies for completeness and accuracy (assembly metrics and BUSCO), computer memory, and CPU times. Two lightweight assemblers, Miniasm/Minimap/Racon and WTDBG, were deemed good for novice users because they involved smaller required learning curves and light computational resources. However, two heavyweight tools, CANU and Flye, should be the first choice when the goal is to achieve accurate and complete assemblies. Our results will provide valuable guidance in future plant genome projects and beyond.},

abstract = {Tropical forest vegetation is shaped by climate and by soil, but understanding how the distributions of individual tree species respond to specific resources has been hindered by high diversity and consequent rarity. To study species over an entire community, we surveyed trees and measured soil chemistry across climatic and geological gradients in central Panama and then used a unique hierarchical model of species occurrence as a function of rainfall and soil chemistry to circumvent analytical difficulties posed by rare species. The results are a quantitative assessment of the responses of 550 tree species to eight environmental factors, providing a measure of the importance of each factor across the entire tree community. Dry-season intensity and soil phosphorus were the strongest predictors, each affecting the distribution of more than half of the species. Although we anticipated clear-cut responses to dry-season intensity, the finding that many species have pronounced associations with either high or low phosphorus reveals a previously unquantified role for this nutrient in limiting tropical tree distributions. The results provide the data necessary for understanding distributional limits of tree species and predicting future changes in forest composition.},

abstract = {Over 400 million hectares of tropical forest are currently designated as logging concessions. This practice is an important source of timber, but there are concerns about its long-term sustainability and impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage. However, logging impacts vary widely, making generalisation and, consequently, policy implementation, difficult. Recent syntheses of animal biodiversity have indicated that differences in logging intensity - the volume of wood removed ha-1 - might help to explain some of these disparities. In addition, it has widely been assumed that reduced impact logging (RIL) might minimise some of the negative effects of logging; though in practice, this has rarely been tested. To test the hypothesis that RIL reduces negative impacts of selective logging once intensity is controlled for, we used meta-analyses of selective logging impact studies, focusing specifically on (1) residual tree damage, (2) aboveground biomass and (3) tree species richness. Our results indicate that RIL appears to reduce residual tree damage when compared to conventional methods. However, changes in aboveground biomass were negatively related to logging intensity. Any effect of RIL, independent of logging intensity, was difficult to discern since it was carried out at relatively low intensities. Tree richness appeared to increase at low intensities but decreased at higher intensities and any effect of RIL was difficult to detect. Our results tentatively support the hypothesis that RIL reduces the negative impacts of logging on tree damage, but do not support suggestions that RIL reduces loss of aboveground biomass or tree species richness. However, this lack of support may be a result of the relative paucity of data on the topic. Based on our results, we suggest that better evidence is needed to assess the differences between the impacts of RIL and conventional logging. Studies that consider plot-level differences in logging intensity are required to fill this knowledge gap. In addition, there must be clarification of whether RIL is an inherently low intensity practice so that this can be factored into management.},

abstract = {This study investigates the functional significance of heterophylly in Ginkgo biloba, where leaves borne on short shoots are ontogenetically distinct from those on long shoots. Short shoots are compact, with minimal internodal elongation; their leaves are supplied with water through mature branches. Long shoots extend the canopy and have significant internodal elongation; their expanding leaves receive water from a shoot that is itself maturing. • Morphology, stomatal traits, hydraulic architecture, Huber values, water trans- port efficiency, in situ gas exchange and laboratory-based steady-state hydraulic conductance were examined for each leaf type. • Both structure and physiology differed markedly between the two leaf types. Short-shoot leaves were thinner and had higher vein density, lower stomatal pore index, smaller bundle sheath extensions and lower hydraulic conductance than long-shoot leaves. Long shoots had lower xylem area : leaf area ratios than short shoots during leaf expansion, but this ratio was reversed at shoot maturity. Long- shoot leaves had higher rates of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and tran- spiration than short-shoot leaves. • We propose that structural differences between the two G. biloba leaf types reflect greater hydraulic limitation of long-shoot leaves during expansion. In turn, differences in physiological performance of short- and long-shoot leaves corre- spond to their distinct ontogeny and architecture. Introduction},

abstract = {In the pantropical mimosoid legume genus Parkia, taxonomic classification has remained controversial in Africa due to clinal phenotypic variations. Three species (P. biglobosa, P. bicolor, and P. filicoidea) are currently recognized, ranging from West to East Africa, with partially overlapping ranges across different floristic regions. However, additional taxa (species or varieties) have been suggested by different authors. To assess species boundaries of African Parkia and phylogeographic patterns within species, we genotyped 889 individuals using 10 microsatellite markers and compared our results with existing morphological descriptions. Bayesian genetic clustering confirmed the species boundaries assessed from morphological traits and did not reveal introgression but identified genetic discontinuities within each species. Six moderately differentiated genetic clusters were recovered in P. biglobosa (pairwise FST: 0.05–0.19), while P. bicolor and P. filicoidea, each, displayed four well-differentiated clusters (FST: 0.18–0.41 and 0.11–0.34, respectively). Within each species, genetic clusters occurred in parapatry. Parkia biglobosa clusters were congruent with the longitudinal clinal variation in leaflets sizes but 26{\%} of individuals presented admixed genotypes. Genetic clusters in P. bicolor and P. filicoidea followed environmental gradients as well as phytogeographic subdivisions. They were also largely congruent with morphological discontinuities described in previous taxonomic studies and {\textless} 10{\%} individuals showed admixed genotypes. We conclude that only one species (P. biglobosa) should be considered in the Guineo-Sudanian savanna. However, P. bicolor and P. filicoidea might each represent a complex of (sub)species. Thus, the hypotheses of cryptic species within P. bicolor and P. filicoidea should be further investigated by testing reproductive barriers.},

abstract = {A central question in community ecology is the means by which species coexist. Models of coexistence often assume that species have fixed trait values and consider questions such as how tradeoffs and environmental variation influence coexistence and diversity. However, species traits can be dynamic, varying between populations and individuals and changing over time as species adapt and evolve, at rates that are relevant to ecological processes. Consequently, adding evolution to ecological coexistence models may modify their predictions and stability in complex or unexpected ways. We extend a well-studied coexistence mechanism depending on resource fluctuations by allowing evolution along a tradeoff between maximum growth rate and competitive ability. Interactions between favorable season length and the period of fluctuations constrain coexistence, with two species coexistence favored by intermediate season length and arising through evolutionary branching or non-local invasion. However, these results depend on the relative rates of ecological and evolutionary processes: rapid evolution leads to a complete breakdown of otherwise stable coexistence. Other coexistence mechanisms should be evaluated from an evolutionary perspective to examine how evolutionary forces may alter predicted ecological dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Key message: We combined aerial LiDAR and ground sensors to map the spatial variation in micro-environmental variables of the tropical forest understory. We show that these metrics depend on forest type and proximity to canopy gaps. Our study has implications for the study of natural forest regeneration. Context: Light impacts seedling dynamics and animals, either directly or through their effect on air temperature and relative humidity. However, the micro-environment of tropical forest understories is heterogeneous. Aims: We explored whether aerial laser scanning (LiDAR) can describe short-scale micro-environmental variables. We also studied the determinants of their spatial and intra-annual variation. Methods: We used a small-footprint LiDAR coverage combined with data obtained from 47 environmental sensors monitoring continuously understory light, moisture and temperature during 1 year over the area. We developed and tested two models relating micro-environmental conditions to LiDAR metrics. Results: We found that a volume-based model predicts empirical light fluxes better than a model based on the proportion of the LiDAR signal reaching the ground. Understory field sensors measured an average daily light flux between 2.9 and 4.7{\%} of full sunlight. Relative seasonal variation was comparable in the understory and in clearings. In canopy gaps, light flux was 4.3 times higher, maximal temperature 15{\%} higher and minimal relative humidity 25{\%} lower than in the forest understory. We found consistent micro-environmental differences among forest types. Conclusions: LiDAR coverage improves the fine-scale description of micro-environmental variables of tropical forest understories. This opens avenues for modelling the distribution and dynamics of animal and plant populations.},

abstract = {Trade-offs maintain diversity and structure communities along environmental gradients. Theory indicates that if covariance among functional traits sets a limit on the number of viable trait com-binations in a given environment, then communities with strong multidimensional trait constraints should exhibit low species diversity. We tested this prediction in winter annual plant assemblages along an aridity gradient using multilevel structural equation modelling. Univariate and multivari-ate functional diversity measures were poorly explained by aridity, and were surprisingly poor pre-dictors of community richness. By contrast, the covariance between maximum height and seed mass strengthened along the aridity gradient, and was strongly associated with richness declines. Community richness had a positive effect on local neighbourhood richness, indicating that climate effects on trait covariance indirectly influence diversity at local scales. We present clear empirical evidence that declines in species richness along gradients of environmental stress can be due to increasing constraints on multidimensional phenotypes.},

abstract = {Plant functional traits are the features (morphological, physiological, phenological) that represent ecological strategies and determine how plants respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels and influence ecosystem properties. Variation in plant functional traits, and trait syndromes, has proven useful for tackling many important ecological questions at a range of scales, giving rise to a demand for standardised ways to measure ecologically meaningful plant traits. This line of research has been among the most fruitful avenues for understanding ecological and evolutionary patterns and processes. It also has the potential both to build a predictive set of local, regional and global relationships between plants and environment and to quantify a wide range of natural and human-driven processes, including changes in biodiversity, the impacts of species invasions, alterations in biogeochemical processes and vegetation–atmosphere interactions. The importance of these topics dictates the urgent need for more and better data, and increases the value of standardised protocols for quantifying trait variation of different species, in particular for traits with power to predict plant- and ecosystem-level processes, and for traits that can be measured relatively easily. Updated and expanded from the widely used previous version, this handbook retains the focus on clearly presented, widely applicable, step-by-step recipes, with a minimum of text on theory, and not only includes updated methods for the traits previously covered, but also introduces many new protocols for further traits. This new handbook has a better balance between whole-plant traits, leaf traits, root and stem traits and regenerative traits, and puts particular emphasis on traits important for predicting species' effects on key ecosystem properties. We hope this new handbook becomes a standard companion in local and global efforts to learn about the responses and impacts of different plant species with respect to environmental changes in the present, past and future.},

abstract = {Understanding variation in key functional traits across gradients in high diversity systems and the ecology of community changes along gradients in these systems is crucial in light of conservation and climate change. We examined inter- and intraspecific variation in leaf mass per area (LMA) of sun and shade leaves along a 3330-m elevation gradient in Peru, and in sun leaves across a forest-savanna vegetation gradient in Brazil. We also compared LMA variance ratios (T-statistics metrics) to null models to explore internal (i.e., abiotic) and environmental filtering on community structure along the gradients. Community-weighted LMA increased with decreasing forest cover in Brazil, likely due to increased light availability and water stress, and increased with elevation in Peru, consistent with the leaf economic spectrum strategy expected in colder, less productive environments. A very high species turnover was observed along both environmental gradients, and consequently, the first source of variation in LMA was species turnover. Variation in LMA at the genus or family levels was greater in Peru than in Brazil. Using dominant trees to examine possible filters on community assembly, we found that in Brazil, internal filtering was strongest in the forest, while environmental filtering was observed in the dry savanna. In Peru, internal filtering was observed along 80{\%} of the gradient, perhaps due to variation in taxa or interspecific competition. Environmental filtering was observed at cloud zone edges and in lowlands, possibly due to water and nutrient availability, respectively. These results related to variation in LMA indicate that biodiversity in species rich tropical assemblages may be structured by differential niche-based processes. In the future, specific mechanisms generating these patterns of variation in leaf functional traits across tropical environmental gradients should be explored.},

abstract = {Repeatability (more precisely the common measure of repeatability, the intra-class correlation coefficient, ICC) is an important index for quantifying the accuracy of measurements and the constancy of phenotypes. It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based, analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM- and GLMM-based approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author.

abstract = {How environmental conditions and population processes determine the abundance and distribution of species is a central problem of ecology and biogeography. Although it has long been recognized hat abundance and distribution are intimately interrelated, the nature of this relationship has not been investigated systematically over the range of spatial scales from local populations to entire geographic ranges of species. On a local scale, i.e., the small habitat patches that constitute most ecologists' study areas, the relationship between population den- sity and spatial distribution of individuals has been studied by many population and community ecologists (e.g., Andrewartha and Birch 1954; Krebs 1978, and numerous references therein). Distribution on a large geographic scale has usually been regarded as the special province of biogeography, whose practitioners often have little experience or interest in population ecology (but see, e.g., Grinnell 1922; MacArthur 1972; Walter 1979; Rapoport 1982; Brown and Gibson 1983). Thus few investigators have systematically studied variation in population density over the geographic range of species. Recently, however, several authors have presented data that suggest a general relationship between local population den- sity and spatial distribution on a geographic scale (e.g., Rabinowitz 1981; Hanski 1982a, 1982b, 1982c; Bock and Ricklefs 1983; J. T. Emlen et al., MS). Here I reanalyze and synthesize some of the diverse information available on the relationship between abundance and distribution. These data suggest ex- tremely general patterns within and among species that appear to hold for organ- isms as diverse as vascular plants, intertidal invertebrates, terrestrial arthropods, planktonic crustaceans, and terrestrial vertebrates. I develop a general theory to explain these relationships. This conceptual construct and the empirical observa- tions that motivated it focus attention on problems that span the boundaries between the traditional disciplines of population ecology, community ecology, biogeography, population genetics, and evolution. Clarification of terminology should facilitate understanding of what follows. The paper is concerned with the relationship between two attributes of popula- tions and species: the density of individuals within a local area and the extent of the distribution of individuals in space. I shall often use the term abundance to refer to local population density, and the terms rare and common (or abundant) to describe extremes of density. Similarly, I shall often use distribution or range to refer to spatial distribution, and the terms restricted (or local) and widespread to describe the extremes.},

abstract = {Foundational to trait-based community ecology is the expectation that functional traits determine demographic outcomes. However, trait–demographic rate relationships are frequently weak, particularly in tree communities. The foundation of trait-based tree community ecology may, therefore, appear to be unstable. Here we argue that there are three core reasons why trait–demographic relationships are generally weak in tree communities. Specifically, important contextual information is frequently ignored, there is too much focus on species relative to individuals, and there are dimensions of tree function that are critical for determining tree demographic rates that are not captured by easily measured functional traits. Rather than being evidence that trait-based community ecology is fundamentally flawed, these issues elucidate a pathway towards a more robust research program.},

abstract = {Summary The variability of branch-level hydraulic properties was assessed across 12 Scots pine populations covering a wide range of environmental conditions, including some of the southernmost populations of the species. The aims were to relate this variability to differences in climate, and to study the potential tradeoffs between traits. Traits measured included wood density, radial growth, xylem anatomy, sapwood- and leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity (KS and KL), vulnerability to embolism, leaf-to-sapwood area ratio (AL : AS), needle carbon isotope discrimination ($\Delta$13C) and nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Between-population variability was high for most of the hydraulic traits studied, but it was directly associated with climate dryness (defined as a combination of atmospheric moisture demand and availability) only for A L : AS, KL and $\Delta$13C. Shoot radial growth and AL : AS declined with stand development, which is consistent with a strategy to avoid exceedingly low water potentials as tree size increases. In addition, we did not find evidence at the intraspecific level of some associations between hydraulic traits that have been commonly reported across species. The adjustment of Scots pine's hydraulic system to local climatic conditions occurred primarily through modifications of AL : AS and direct stomatal control, whereas intraspecific variation in vulnerability to embolism and leaf physiology appears to be limited. {\textcopyright} 2009 New Phytologist.},

abstract = {Abstract  Tree species differences in crown size and shape are often highlighted as key characteristics determining light interception strategies and successional dynamics. The phenotypic plasticity of species in response to light and space availability suggests that intraspecific variability can have potential consequences on light interception and community dynamics. Species crown size varies depending on site characteristics and other factors at the individual level which differ from competition for light and space. These factors, such as individual genetic characteristics, past disturbances or environmental micro-site effects, combine with competition-related phenotypic plasticity to determine the individual variability in crown size. Site and individual variability are typically ignored when considering crown size and light interception by trees, and residual variability is relegated to a residual error term, which is then ignored when studying ecological processes. In the present study, we structured and quantified variability at the species, site, and individual levels for three frequently used tree allometric relations using fixed and random effects in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We focused on two species: Abies alba (silver fir) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) in nine forest stands of the western Alps. We demonstrated that species had different allometric relations from site to site and that individual variability accounted for a large part of the variation in allometric relations. Using a spatially explicit radiation transmission model on real stands, we showed that individual variability in tree allometry had a substantial impact on light resource allocation in the forest. Individual variability in tree allometry modulates species{\^{a}} light-intercepting ability. It generates heterogeneous light conditions under the canopy, with high light micro-habitats that may promote the regeneration of light-demanding species and slow down successional dynamics.},

abstract = {The rapidly growing human population in West Africa has generated increasing demand for agricultural land and forest products. Consequently 90{\%} of the original rainforest cover has now disappeared and the remainder is heavily fragmented and highly degraded. Although many studies have focused on carbon stocks and fluxes in intact African forests, little information exists on biomass recovery rates in secondary forests. We studied a chronosequence of 96 secondary and old-growth forest fragments (0.2 ha each) where 32.103 trees with Diameter at Breast Height {\textgreater}2.5 cm have been censused. We modelled the biomass recovery trajectories in a time-explicit Bayesian framework and tested the effect on recovery rates of a large set of covariates related to the physical environment, plot history, and forest connectivity. Recovery rate trajectory is highly non-linear: recovery rates accelerated from 1 to 37 years, when biomass recovery reached 4.23 Mg{\textperiodcentered}ha−1{\textperiodcentered}yr−1, and decelerated afterwards. We predict that, on average, 10{\%}, 25{\%} and 50{\%} of the old-growth forest biomass is respectively recovered 17, 30, and 51 years after abandonment. Recovery rates are strongly shaped by both the number of remnant trees (residuals of the former old-growth forest) and the previous crop cultivated before abandonment. The latter induced large differences in the time needed to recover 50{\%} of an old-growth forest biomass: from 38 years for former Yam fields up to 86 years for former rice fields. Our results emphasize (i) the very slow recovery rates of West African forests, as compared to Neotropical forests (ii) the long-lasting impacts of past human activities and management choices on ecosystem biomass recovery in West African degraded forests.},

The objectives were (1) to determine the relative importance of ITV at different ecological scales; (2) to understand how functional leaf traits relate to each other, and (3) to know the main climatic factors related to ITV in P. pallida. We used the restricted maximum likelihood method to decompose the variance across three nested ecological scales (tree, plot, and population level). The relative variance decomposition showed that tree level was the main source of variation for leaf chemical composition and stomatal size and density, whereas the plot and population levels were the main sources of variation for gas exchange and structural variables, respectively. Leaf ITV followed the general trends of the leaf economic spectrum, with negative relationships of leaf mass per area with both photosynthetic rate and leaf nitrogen. Precipitation was not related to any of the leaf traits, while mean annual temperature was correlated negatively with leaf relative water content and positively with water use efficiency. Our results highlight the importance of ITV in P. pallida and the possible impact of climate change.},

However, representing this diversity at the global scale is challenging. Typically, in Earth system models, characterization of plant diversity has been limited to grouping related species into plant functional types (PFTs), with all trait variation in a PFT collapsed into a single mean value that is applied globally. Using the largest global plant trait database and state of the art Bayesian modeling, we created fine-grained global maps of plant trait distributions that can be applied to Earth system models.

We use qualitative and quantitative methods to describe students' definitions, identify common misconceptions, and examine differences before and after instruction on genetic drift. We identify and describe five overarching categories that include 16 distinct misconceptions about genetic drift. The accuracy of students' conceptions ranges considerably, from responses indicating only superficial, if any, knowledge of any aspect of evolution to responses indicating knowledge of genetic drift but confusion about the nuances of genetic drift. After instruction, a significantly greater number of responses indicate some knowledge of genetic drift (p = 0.005), but 74.6{\%} of responses still contain at least one misconception. We conclude by presenting a framework that organizes how students' conceptions of genetic drift change with instruction. We also articulate three hypotheses regarding undergraduates' conceptions of evolution in general and genetic drift in particular. We propose that: 1) students begin with undeveloped conceptions of evolution that do not recognize different mechanisms of change; 2) students develop more complex, but still inaccurate, conceptual frameworks that reflect experience with vocabulary but still lack deep understanding; and 3) some new misconceptions about genetic drift emerge as students comprehend more about evolution. {\textcopyright} 2012 T.

Application to USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data in the eastern United States demon- strates an apparent paradox, that the analysis of species better explains and predicts traits than does direct analysis of the traits themselves; trait data contain less, not more, infor- mation than species on environmental responses. Whereas variation in some traits is dom- inated by inherent syndromes (tendency for certain traits to be associated with others within an individual and species), others are strongly controlled by variation in species diversity. There is substantial variation in environmental control on trait patterns, between traits and regionally.

abstract = {An important goal in plant community ecology is to understand how species traits determine demographic performance. Several functional traits have been shown to correlate with growth and mortality rates in trees, but less is known about how the relationships between functional traits and demographic rates change with tree size. We examined the associations of functional traits with growth and mortality across 43 tree species in the Fushan 25-ha subtropical rain forest plot in northern Taiwan. We estimated the 95th percentile maximum stem diameter, wood density and six leaf functional traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, thickness, succulence, and mass-based nitrogen and phosphorus contents) obtained from leaves on juvenile and adult individuals of each species. To quantify size-dependent changes in growth and mortality, relative growth rate (RGR) and mortality were estimated as a function of stem diameter using hierarchical Bayesian models. These rate estimates were then correlated with functional traits at a range of stem diameter classes. Relationships between functional traits and demographic rates varied with tree size. Maximum size was positively correlated with RGR across a wide range of tree sizes. Wood density was negatively correlated with RGR and mortality for small-sized trees. Leaf traits such as leaf area and specific leaf area at juvenile and adult stages were associated more strongly with demographic rates for corresponding sizes than from other sizes. Synthesis. The observed size-dependent changes in the trait-demography relationships are possibly due to the effects of developmental and environmental changes with increasing tree size. The underlying effects of functional traits on demographic performance vary with tree size, and this should influence dynamics in a tree community.},

abstract = {1.Intraspecific trait variation (ITV) is hypothesized to play an important role in community assembly and the maintenance of biodiversity. However, fundamental gaps remain in our understanding of how ITV contributes to mechanisms that create spatial variation in the functional-trait composition of communities (functional $\beta$-diversity). Importantly, ITV may influence the perceived importance of environmental filtering across spatial scales. 2.We examined how ITV contributes to functional $\beta$-diversity and environmental filtering in woody plant communities in a temperate forest in the Ozark ecoregion, Missouri, USA. To test the hypothesis that ITV contributes to changes in the perceived importance of environmental filtering across scales, we compared patterns of functional $\beta$-diversity across soil-resource and topographic gradients at three spatial grains and three spatial extents. To quantify the contribution of ITV to functional $\beta$-diversity, we compared patterns that included ITV in five traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf water content, leaf toughness, and chlorophyll content) to patterns based on species-mean trait values. 3.Functional $\beta$-diversity that included ITV increased with spatial extent and decreased with spatial grain, suggesting stronger environmental filtering within spatially extensive landscapes that contain populations locally adapted to different habitats. In contrast, functional $\beta$-diversity based on species-mean trait values increased with spatial extent but did not change with spatial grain, suggesting weaker environmental filtering among larger communities which each contain a variety of habitats and locally adapted populations. 4.Synthesis. Although studies typically infer community assembly mechanisms from species-mean trait values, our study suggests that mean trait values may mask the strength of assembly mechanisms such as environmental filtering, especially in landscape-scale studies that encompass strong environmental gradients and locally adapted populations. Our study highlights the utility of integrating ITV into studies of functional $\beta$-diversity to better understand the ecological conditions under which trait variation within and among species contributes most strongly to patterns of biodiversity across spatial scales.},

The negative associations between overstorey tree species diversity and understorey biomass possibly resulted from greater resource filtering by overstorey trees in ecosystems with more diverse overstorey tree species.$\backslash$n},

@article{peterschmitt_yellowing_1996,
abstract = {A sequence of red through yellow to grey soils from well drained hilltops to poorly drained valleys is common on the backslopes of the Western Ghaˆts, Southern India. Detailed field observations along a representative toposequence developed from weathered schists, and local petrographic, mineralogical and chemical investigations are used to (i) link yellow, white and brown features to yellowing, bleaching and ferritisation processes, and (ii) relate the enlargement of these features and the development of these processes to aquic and drainage conditions. Precise demarcation of soil morphological features at toposequence scale permits to differentiate an upslope ferralitic domain from a dowslope hydromorphic domain. In each of these domains, geometrical relationships expressed in terms of either concordance or discordance between horizon and colour boundaries are taken as arguments to point out that aquic conditions have expanded upslope in the landscape at some time in the past. As a consequence partial and selective dissolution of iron oxides resulted in yellowing of reddish soil material. Dissolution which affected first hematite then gcethite was controlled by Al substitution in the crystal structure of iron oxides. It has been reproduced in the laboratory using a chemical reducing agent. Yellowing is associated with the onset of aquic conditions: yellow colours occur predominantly at the periphery of the hydromorphic domain. In the hydromorphic domain, complete removal of iron oxides similarly resulted in bleaching of yellow materials and was linked to waterlogging. Iron mobilized by yellowing and bleaching processes moved along established flow paths, and locally crystallized and concentrated in saprolite by ferritisation. Bleaching and ferritisation occurred downslope and downward into the soil to form the inner white-brown zone of the hydromorphic domain. The amount of iron stored in low lying positions and the development of weakly weathering conditions suggest that the internal drainage of the ground watertables was limited. This study cannot conclude if yellowing, bleaching and ferritisation are still actively occurring, as no hydo-geochemical investigations were conducted along the toposequence.},

abstract = {Background: The importance of intraspecific trait variation (ITV) is increasingly acknowledged among plant ecologists. However, our understanding of what drives ITV between individual plants (ITVBI) at the population level is still limited. Contrasting theoretical hypotheses state that ITVBI can be either suppressed (stress-reduced plasticity hypothesis) or enhanced (stress-induced variability hypothesis) under high abiotic stress. Similarly, other hypotheses predict either suppressed (niche packing hypothesis) or enhanced ITVBI (individual variation hypothesis) under high niche packing in species rich communities. In this study we assess the relative effects of both abiotic and biotic niche effects on ITVBI of four functional traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, plant height and seed mass), for three herbaceous plant species across a 2300km long gradient in Europe. The study species were the slow colonizing Anemone nemorosa, a species with intermediate colonization rates, Milium effusum, and the fast colonizing, non-native Impatiens glandulifera. Results: Climatic stress consistently increased ITVBI across species and traits. Soil nutrient stress, on the other hand, reduced ITVBI for A. nemorosa and I. glandulifera, but had a reversed effect for M. effusum. We furthermore observed a reversed effect of high niche packing on ITVBI for the fast colonizing non-native I. glandulifera (increased ITVBI), as compared to the slow colonizing native A. nemorosa and M. effusum (reduced ITVBI). Additionally, ITVBI in the fast colonizing species tended to be highest for the vegetative traits plant height and leaf area, but lowest for the measured generative trait seed mass. Conclusions: This study shows that stress can both reduce and increase ITVBI, seemingly supporting both the stress-reduced plasticity and stress-induced variability hypotheses. Similarly, niche packing effects on ITVBI supported both the niche packing hypothesis and the individual variation hypothesis. These results clearly illustrates the importance of simultaneously evaluating both abiotic and biotic factors on ITVBI. This study adds to the growing realization that within-population trait variation should not be ignored and can provide valuable ecological insights.},

abstract = {Aim Climatic niche modelling of species and community distributions implicitly assumes strong and constant climatic determinism across geographical space. We tested this assumption by assessing how stacked-species distribution models (S-SDMs) perform for predicting plant species assemblages along elevation gradients. Location The western Swiss Alps. Methods Using robust presence–absence data, we first assessed the ability of topo-climatic S-SDMs to predict plant assemblages in a study area encompassing a 2800-m wide elevation gradient. We then assessed the relationships among several evaluation metrics and trait-based tests of community assembly rules. Results The standard errors of individual SDMs decreased significantly towards higher elevations. Overall, the S-SDM overpredicted far more than they underpredicted richness and could not reproduce the humpback curve along elevation. Overprediction was greater at low and mid-range elevations in absolute values but greater at high elevations when standardized by the actual richness. Looking at species composition, overall prediction success, kappa and specificity increased with increasing elevation, while the Jaccard index and sensitivity decreased. The best overall evaluation – as driven by specificity – occurred at high elevation where species assemblages were shown to be subject to significant environmental filtering of small plants. In contrast, the decreased overall accuracy in the lowlands was associated with functional patterns representing any type of assembly rule (environmental filtering, limiting similarity or null assembly). Main conclusions We provide a thorough evaluation of S-SDM emphasizing the need to carefully interpret standard evaluation metrics, which reflect different aspects of assemblage predictions. We further reported interesting patterns of change in S-SDM errors with changes in assembly rules along elevation. Yet, significant levels of assemblage prediction errors occurred throughout the gradient, calling for further improvement of SDMs, e.g. by adding key environmental filters that act at fine scales and developing approaches to account for variations in the influence of predictors along environmental gradients},

Summary: Understanding the forces that shape the great amount of variation in plant longevity, reproductive output and growth rate is fundamental to effective predictions of viability, invasions and evolutionary pressures. Here, I extend the recently introduced ‘fast–slow continuum and reproductive strategy' framework to quantify the variation in plant life history strategies world-wide. I use high-resolution demographic information from 625 plant species and show that this framework predicts not only key demographic properties, such as population growth rate and demographic resilience, but also has important connections to the leaf economics spectrum, biogeographical characteristics, evolutionary biology and conservation biology. This framework may allow plant biologists to unlock powerful global plant predictions from a handful of open-access field measurements.},

However, the causes of variation in rates of molecular evolution remain poorly understood, particularly in plants. Here we show that height accounts for about one-fifth of the among-lineage rate variation in the chloroplast and nuclear genomes of plants. This relationship holds across 138 families of flowering plants, and when accounting for variation in species richness, temperature, ultraviolet radiation, latitude and growth form. Our observations can be explained by a link between height and rates of genome copying in plants, and we propose a mechanistic hypothesis to account for this - the 'rate of mitosis' hypothesis. This hypothesis has the potential to explain many disparate observations about rates of molecular evolution across the tree of life. Our results have implications for understanding the evolutionary history and future of plant lineages in a changing world. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

In order to use multiple logistic regression, many studies have simulated "pseudo-absences" through a number of strategies, but it is unknown how the choice of strategy influences models and their geographic predictions of species. In this paper we evaluate the effect of several prevailing pseudo-absence strategies on the predictions of the geographic distribution of a virtual species whose "true" distribution and relationship to three environmental predictors was predefined. We evaluated the effect of using a) real absences b) pseudo-absences selected randomly from the background and c) two-step approaches: pseudo-absences selected from low suitability areas predicted by either Ecological Niche Factor Analysis: (ENFA) or BIOCLIM. We compared how the choice of pseudo-absence strategy affected model fit, predictive power, and information-theoretic model selection results.},

Given this, we analyzed a new global database of Rdark and associated leaf traits. * Data for 899 species were compiled from 100 sites (from the Arctic to the tropics). Several woody and nonwoody plant functional types (PFTs) were represented. Mixed-effects models were used to disentangle sources of variation in Rdark. * Area-based Rdark at the prevailing average daily growth temperature (T) of each site increased only twofold from the Arctic to the tropics, despite a 20°C increase in growing T (8–28°C). By contrast, Rdark at a standard T (25°C, Rdark25) was threefold higher in the Arctic than in the tropics, and twofold higher at arid than at mesic sites. Species and PFTs at cold sites exhibited higher Rdark25 at a given photosynthetic capacity (Vcmax25) or leaf nitrogen concentration ([N]) than species at warmer sites. Rdark25 values at any given Vcmax25 or [N] were higher in herbs than in woody plants. * The results highlight variation in Rdark among species and across global gradients in T and aridity. In addition to their ecological significance, the results provide a framework for improving representation of Rdark in terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) and associated land-surface components of Earth system models (ESMs).},

@article{Zhang2017,
abstract = {There is growing concern over rates of global species diversity loss and its implications on healthy ecosystem functioning. While positive relationships between tree species diversity and forest biomass production have been observed, forests are structurally complex, consisting of understorey vegetation layers that also contribute to ecosystem functioning as they often account for the majority of species richness. However, relationships between understorey vegetation diversity and function are largely unexplored. Further, few studies have simultaneously assessed how both overstorey and understory vegetation interact and contribute to overall ecosystem function. By analysing Canada's National Forest Inventory database using structural equation modelling, we explored the relationships between species richness and above-ground biomass production across forest vegetation strata while accounting for potentially confounding factors, including climate, physical site characteristics, and forest ageing. We found positive relationships between species richness and biomass production across all forest vegetation layers, but the relationship was strongest for the overstorey layer. Species richness of the understorey tree, shrub, and herb layers was positively related to overstorey species richness. However, overstorey biomass had a negative effect on the biomass production of all understorey layers. Our results suggest that resource filtering by overstorey trees might have reduced the strength of the positive diversity-productivity relationships in the forest understorey, supporting previous hypotheses that the magnitude and direction of diversity-productivity relationships is context specific and dependent on the conditions of the surrounding environment. Further, heterogeneity in understory resources, as affected by the overstorey, may promote niche complementarity as the main mechanism driving diversity-productivity relationships in understorey vegetation.

@article{Cardinale2007,
abstract = {Accelerating rates of species extinction have prompted a growing number of researchers to manipulate the richness of various groups of organisms and examine how this aspect of diversity impacts ecological processes that control the functioning of ecosystems. We summarize the results of 44 experiments that have manipulated the richness of plants to examine how plant diversity affects the production of biomass. We show that mixtures of species produce an average of 1.7 times more biomass than species monocultures and are more productive than the average monoculture in 79{\%} of all experiments. However, in only 12{\%} of all experiments do diverse polycultures achieve greater biomass than their single most productive species. Previously, a positive net effect of diversity that is no greater than the most productive species has been interpreted as evidence for selection effects, which occur when diversity maximizes the chance that highly productive species will be included in and ultimately dominate the biomass of polycultures. Contrary to this, we show that although productive species do indeed contribute to diversity effects, these contributions are equaled or exceeded by species complementarity, where biomass is augmented by biological processes that involve multiple species. Importantly, both the net effect of diversity and the probability of polycultures being more productive than their most productive species increases through time, because the magnitude of complementarity increases as experiments are run longer. Our results suggest that experiments to date have, if anything, underestimated the impacts of species extinction on the productivity of ecosystems.},

abstract = {Traits have been widely used in plant ecology to understand the rules governing community assembly, and to characterize primary strategies that define community structure and ecosystem properties. Relatively little is known as to whether the traits that are ecologically important at macroecological scales are either variable, or of consequence at fine scales within species. We measured trait variation within populations of the grassland plants Festuca ovina L. and Koeleria macrantha (Ledeb.) Schult., to test the hypothesis that fine-scale intraspecific trait variation drives local community structure. Both species showed large genotypic variation for all traits. Size-related traits of genotypes of K. macrantha observed under monoculture predicted their performance in model grassland communities that possessed both genetic and species diversity. The same correspondence was much weaker for the experimental population of F. ovina. A trade-off in allocation between shoot mass and relative allocation to reproduction was evident in the experimental population of F. ovina. Furthermore, both species showed evidence of a positive relationship between specific leaf area (SLA) and allocation to culm mass. This trait covariation indicates the existence of intraspecific trade-offs in life-history and growth strategies similar to those used to define primary plant strategies, which potentially buffers both species abundance and species coexistence against environmental challenges.},

In this context, replacing taxonomic predictors by trait-based measures of functional composition (FC)—bridging functions of species and of ecosystems—is a widely used approach. The inherent challenge of trait-based approaches is the multi-faceted, dynamic and hierarchical nature of trait influence: (i) traits may act via different facets of their distribution in a community, (ii) their influence may change over time and (iii) traits may influence processes at different levels of the natural hierarchy of organization. Here, we made use of the forest ecosystem model ‘LPJ-GUESS' parametrized with empirical trait data, which creates output of individual performance, community assembly, stand-level states and processes. To address the three challenges, we resolved the dynamics of the top-level ecosystem function ‘annual biomass change' hierarchically ...},

abstract = {As ecological data are usually analysed at a scale different from the one at which the process of interest operates, interpretations can be confusing and controversial. For example, hypothesised differences between species do not operate at the species level, but concern individuals responding to environmental variation, including competition with neighbours. Aggregated data from many individuals subject to spatio-temporal variation are used to produce species-level averages, which marginalise away the relevant (process-level) scale. Paradoxically, the higher the dimensionality, the more ways there are to differ, yet the more species appear the same. The aggregate becomes increasingly irrelevant and misleading. Standard analyses can make species look the same, reverse species rankings along niche axes, make the surprising prediction that a species decreases in abundance when a competitor is removed from a model, or simply preclude parameter estimation. Aggregation explains why niche differences hidden at the species level become apparent upon disaggregation to the individual level, why models suggest that individual-level variation has a minor impact on diversity when disaggregation shows it to be important, and why literature-based synthesis can be unfruitful. We show how to identify when aggregation is the problem, where it has caused controversy, and propose three ways to address it. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors. Methods in Ecology and Evolution {\textcopyright} 2016 British Ecological SocietyBiologists are increasingly interested in decomposing trait dynamics into underlying processes, such as evolution, plasticity and demography. Four important frameworks that allow for such a decomposition are the quantitative genetic animal model (AM), the ‘Geber' method (GM), the age-structured Price equation (APE) and the integral projection model (IPM). However, as these frameworks have largely been developed independently, they differ in the assumptions they make, the data they require, as well as their outcomes and interpretation. Here, we evaluate how each framework decomposes trait dynamics into underlying processes. To do so, we apply them to simulated data for a hypothetical animal population. Individual body size was affected by, among others, genes, maternal effects and food intake. We simulated scenarios with and without selection on body size and with high and low heritability. The APE and IPM provided similar results, as did the AM and GM, with important differences between the former and the latter. All frameworks detected positive contributions of selection in the high but not in the low selection scenarios. However, only the AM and GM distinguished between the high and low heritability scenarios. Furthermore, the AM and GM revealed a high contribution of plasticity. The APE and IPM attributed most of the change in body size to ontogenetic growth and inheritance, where the latter captures the combined effects of plasticity, maternal effects and heritability. We show how these apparent discrepancies are mostly due to differences in aims and definitions. For example, the APE and IPM capture selection, whereas the AM and GM focus on the response to selection. Furthermore, the frameworks differ in the processes that are ascribed to plasticity and in how they take into account demography. We conclude that no single framework provides the ‘true' contributions of evolution, plasticity and demography. Instead, different research questions require different frameworks. A thorough understanding of the different definitions of their components is necessary for selecting the most appropriate framework for the question at hand and for making biologically meaningful inferences. This work thus supports both future analysis and the careful interpretation of existing work.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors. Methods in Ecology and Evolution {\textcopyright} 2017 British Ecological Society Extensive empirical work has demonstrated local adaptation to discrete environments, yet few studies have elucidated the genetic and environment mechanisms that generate it. Here, we advocate for research that broadens our understanding of local adaptation beyond pattern and towards process. We discuss how studies of local adaptation can be designed to address two unresolved questions in evolutionary ecology: Does local adaptation result from fitness trade-offs at individual loci across habitats? How do agents of selection interact to generate local adaptation to discrete contrasting habitats types and continuous environmental gradients? To inform future investigations of the genetic basis of local adaptation, we conducted a literature review of studies that mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) for fitness in native field environments using reciprocal transplant experiments with hybrid mapping populations or Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) panels. We then reviewed the literature for field experiments that disentangle the contributions of various agents of selection to local adaptation. For each question, we suggest future lines of inquiry and discuss implications for climate change and agriculture research. (i) Studies in the native habitats of five biological systems revealed that local adaptation is more often caused by conditional neutrality than genetic trade-offs at the level of the QTL. We consider the ramifications of this result and discuss knowledge gaps in our current understanding of the genetic basis of local adaptation. (ii) We uncovered only five studies that identified the agents of selection that contribute to local adaptation, and nearly all were conducted in discrete habitats rather than across the continuous environmental gradients that many species inhabit. We introduce a novel experimental framework for illuminating the processes underlying local adaptation. A holistic view of local adaptation is critical for predicting the responses of organisms to climate change, enhancing conservation efforts, and developing strategies to improve crop resilience to environmental stress. Experiments that manipulate agents of selection in native field environments using pedigreed populations or GWAS panels offer unique opportunities for detecting the genetic and environmental mechanisms that generate local adaptation.},

abstract = {Mixed-ploidy species harbor a unique form of genomic and phenotypic variation that influences ecological interactions, facilitates genetic divergence, and offers insights into the mechanisms of polyploid evolution. However, there have been few attempts to synthesize this literature. We review here research on the cytotype distribution, diversity, and dynamics of intensively studied mixed-ploidy species and consider the implications for understanding mechanisms of polyploidization such as cytotype formation, establishment, coexistence, and post-polyploid divergence. In general, mixed-ploidy species are unevenly represented among families: they exhibit high cytotype diversity, often within populations, and frequently comprise rare and odd-numbered ploidies. Odd-ploidies often occur in association with asexuality. We highlight research hypotheses and opportunities that take advantage of the unique properties of ploidy variation. Detailed descriptions of ploidy diversity have been published for many mixed-ploidy species. Future advances require robust tests of specific hypotheses pertaining to the origin and maintenance of ploidy diversity using experimental and comparative approaches. The underlying ecological and genetic mechanisms of polyploid evolution have mostly been investigated in a piecemeal fashion. Analyses of multiple factors within one system and comparisons across systems are necessary. Emerging experimental and molecular evidence suggests that ploidy differences are an imperfect barrier to gene flow. The intensity of gene flow and its causes, asymmetries, and variation among polyploid systems require further study. More emphasis is needed on separating the immediate effects of genome multiplication from evolutionary divergence and selection affecting polyploids once they arise.},

References Summary Although the relationship between species diversity and biomass productivity has been extensively studied in grasslands, the impact of tree species diversity on forest productivity, as well as the main drivers of this relationship, are still under discussion. It is widely accepted that the magnitude of the relationship between tree diversity and forest stand productivity is context specific and depends on environmental conditions, but the underlying mechanisms of this relationship are still not fully understood. Competition reduction and facilitation have been identified as key mechanisms driving the diversity–productivity relationship. However, contrasting results have been reported with respect to the extent to which competition reduction and facilitation determine the diversity–productivity relationship. They appear to depend on regional climate, soil fertility, functional diversity of the tree species involved, and developmental stage of the forest. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge and to suggest a conceptual framework to explain the various processes leading to higher productivity of species-rich forests compared with average yields of their respective monocultures. This framework provides three pathways for possible development of the diversity–productivity relationship under a changing climate.},

abstract = {Genetic variation of bud burst and early growth components was estimated in a full-sib family of Quercus robur L. comprising 278 offspring. The full sibs were vegetatively propagated, and phenotypic assessments were made in three field tests. This two-generation pedigree was also used to construct a genetic linkage map (12 linkage groups, 128 markers) and locate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling bud burst and growth components. In each field test, the date of bud burst extended over a period of 20 days from the earliest to the latest clone. Bud burst exhibited higher heritability (0.15-0.51) than growth components (0.04-0.23) and also higher correlations across field tests. Over the three tests there were 32 independent detected QTLs (P ≤ 5{\%} at the chromosome level) controlling bud burst, which likely represent at least 12 unique genes or chromosomal regions controlling this trait. QTLs explained from 3{\%} to 11{\%} of the variance of the clonal means. The number of QTLs controlling height growth components was lower and varied between two and four. However the contribution of each QTL to the variance of the clonal mean was higher (from 4{\%} to 19{\%}). These results indicate that the genetic architecture of two important fitness-related traits are quite different. On the one hand, bud burst is controlled by several QTLs with rather low to moderate effects, but contributing to a high genetic (additive) variance. On the other hand, height growth depends on fewer QTLs with moderate to strong effects, resulting in lower heritabilities of the trait. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {The struggle for existence occurs through the vital rates of population growth. This basic fact demonstrates the tight connection between ecology and evolution that defines the emerging field of eco-evolutionary dynamics. An effective synthesis of the interdependencies between ecology and evolution is grounded in six principles. The mechanics of evolution specifies the origin and rules governing traits and evolutionary strategies. Traits and evolutionary strategies achieve their selective value through their functional relationships with fitness. Function depends on the underlying structure of variation and the temporal, spatial and organizational scales of evolution. An understanding of how changes in traits and strategies occur requires conjoining ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Adaptation merges these five pillars to achieve a comprehensive understanding of ecological and evolutionary change. I demonstrate the value of this world-view with reference to the theory and practice of habitat selection. The theory allows us to assess evolutionarily stable strategies and states of habitat selection, and to draw the adaptive landscapes for habitat-selecting species. The landscapes can then be used to forecast future evolution under a variety of climate change and other scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society.},

@article{Tilman1999,
abstract = {This paper uses theory and experiments to explore the effects of diversity on stability, productivity, and susceptibility to invasion. A model of resource competition predicts that increases in diversity cause community stability to increase, but population stability to decrease. These opposite effects are, to a great extent, explained by how temporal variances in species abundances scale with mean abundance, and by the differential impact of this scaling on population vs. community stability. Community stability also depends on a negative covariance effect (competitive compensation) and on overyielding (ecosystem productivity increasing with diversity). A long-term study in Minnesota grasslands supports these predictions. Models of competition predict, and field experiments confirm, that greater plant diversity leads to greater primary productivity. This diversity-productivity relationship results both from the greater chance that a more productive species would be present at higher diversity (the sampling effect) and from the better "coverage" of habitat heterogeneity caused by the broader range of species traits in a more diverse community (the niche differentiation effect). Both effects cause more complete utilization of limiting resources at higher diversity, which increases resource retention, further increasing productivity. Finally, lower levels of available limiting resources at higher diversity are predicted to decrease the susceptibility of an ecosystem to invasion, supporting the diversity-invasibility hypothesis. This mechanism provides rules for community assembly and invasion resistance. In total, biodiversity should be added to species composition, disturbance, nutrient supply, and climate as a major controller of population and ecosystem dynamics and structure. By their increasingly great directional impacts on all of these controllers, humans are likely to cause major long-term changes in the functioning of ecosystems worldwide. A better understanding of these ecosystem changes is needed if ecologists are to provide society with the knowledge essential for wise management of the earth and its biological resources.},

Increasing domination of ecosystems by humans is steadily transforming them into depauperate systems. How will this loss of biodiversity affect the functioning and stability of natural and managed ecosystems? This volume provides the first comprehensive and balanced coverage of recent empirical and theoretical research on this question. It reviews the evidence, provides bases for the resolution of the debate that has divided scientists on these issues, and offers perspectives on how current knowledge can be extended to other ecosystems, other organisms and other spatial and temporal scales. It cuts across the traditional division between community ecology and ecosystem ecology, and announces a new ecological synthesis in which the dynamics of biological diversity and the biogeochemical functioning of the Earth system are merged.},

abstract = {DNA is a remarkably precise medium for copying and storing biological information. This high fidelity results from the action of hundreds of genes involved in replication, proofreading, and damage repair. Evolutionary theory suggests that in such a system, selection has limited ability to remove genetic variants that change mutation rates by small amounts or in specific sequence contexts. Consistent with this, using SNV variation as a proxy for mutational input, we report here that mutational spectra differ substantially among species, human continental groups and even some closely related populations. Close examination of one signal, an increased TCC!TTC mutation rate in Europeans, indicates a burst of mutations from about 15,000 to 2000 years ago, perhaps due to the appearance, drift, and ultimate elimination of a genetic modifier of mutation rate. Our results suggest that mutation rates can evolve markedly over short evolutionary timescales and suggest the possibility of mapping mutational modifiers.},

abstract = {A compilation was made of 307 studies using nuclear DNA markers for evaluating among- and within-population diversity in wild angiosperms and gymnosperms. Estimates derived by the dominantly inherited markers (RAPD, AFLP, ISSR) are very similar and may be directly comparable. STMS analysis yields almost three times higher values for within-population diversity whereas among-population diversity estimates are similar to those derived by the dominantly inherited markers. Number of sampled plants per population and number of scored microsatellite DNA alleles are correlated with some of the population genetics parameters. In addition, maximum geographical distance between sampled populations has a strong positive effect on among-population diversity. As previously verified with allozyme data, RAPD- and STMS-based analyses show that long-lived, outcrossing, late successional taxa retain most of their genetic variability within populations. By contrast, annual, selfing and/or early successional taxa allocate most of the genetic variability among populations. Estimates for among- and within-population diversity, respectively, were negatively correlated. The only major discrepancy between allozymes and STMS on the one hand, and RAPD on the other hand, concerns geographical range; within-population diversity was strongly affected when the former methods were used but not so in the RAPD-based studies. Direct comparisons between the different methods, when applied to the same plant material, indicate large similarities between the dominant markers and somewhat lower similarity with the STMS-based data, presumably due to insufficient number of analysed microsatellite DNA loci in many studies.},

This conceptual framework ignores the dynamic nature of species pools and fails to recognize that communities are assembled by processes operating over a vast range of temporal and spatial scales. Species pool richness and composition are influenced by metacommunity dynamics over short timescales and by speciation, extinction, and dispersal over long timescales.

@misc{Albert2011a,
abstract = {Trait-based studies have become extremely common in plant ecology. Trait-based approaches often rely on the tacit assumption that intraspecific trait variability (ITV) is negligible compared to interspecific variability, so that species can be characterized by mean trait values. Yet, numerous recent studies have challenged this assumption by showing that ITV significantly affects various ecological processes. Accounting for ITV may thus strengthen trait-based approaches, but measuring trait values on a large number of individuals per species and site is not feasible. Therefore, it is important and timely to synthesize existing knowledge on ITV in order to (1) decide critically when ITV should be considered, and (2) establish methods for incorporating this variability. Here we propose a practical set of rules to identify circumstances under which ITV should be accounted for. We formulate a spatial trait variance partitioning hypothesis to highlight the spatial scales at which ITV cannot be ignored in ecological studies. We then refine a set of four consecutive questions on the research question, the spatial scale, the sampling design, and the type of studied traits, to determine case-by-case if a given study should quantify ITV and test its effects. We review methods for quantifying ITV and develop a step-by-step guideline to design and interpret simulation studies that test for the importance of ITV. Even in the absence of quantitative knowledge on ITV, its effects can be assessed by varying trait values within species within realistic bounds around the known mean values. We finish with a discussion of future requirements to further incorporate ITV within trait-based approaches. This paper thus delineates a general framework to account for ITV and suggests a direction towards a more quantitative trait-based ecology. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the life history and ecological characteristics of woody plant spe-cies allow predictions of the level and distribution of genetic diversity within and among po-pulations. Generalizations developed from such analyses can be used to develop sampling strategies for the preservation of genetic diversity. Abstract. The plant allozyme literature was reviewed to: (1) compare genetic diversity in long-lived woody species with species representing other life forms, and (2) to investigate whether the levels and distribution of genetic diversity in woody species are related to life history and ecological characteristics. Data from 322 woody taxa were used to measure genetic diversity within species, and within and among populations of species. Woody species maintain more variation within species and within populations than species with other life forms but have less variation among populations. Woody species with large geographic ranges, outcrossing breeding systems, and wind or animal-ingested seed dispersal have more genetic diversity within species and populations but less variation among populations than woody species with other combinations of traits. Although life history and ecological traits explain a significant proportion (34{\%}) of the variation among species for the genetic parameters measured, a large proportion of the interspecific variation is unexplained. The specific evolutionary history of each species must play an important role in determining the level and distribution of genetic diversity.},

abstract = {We examined tree-soil habitat associations in lowland forest communities at Paracou, French Guiana. We analyzed a large dataset assembling six permanent plots totaling 37.5 ha, in which extensive LIDAR-derived topographical data and soil chemical and physical data have been integrated with precise botanical determinations. Map of relative elevation from the nearest stream summarized both soil fertility and hydromorphic characteristics, with seasonally inundated bottomlands having higher soil phosphate content and base saturation, and plateaus having higher soil carbon, nitrogen and aluminum contents. We employed a statistical test of correlations between tree species density and environmental maps, by generating Monte Carlo simulations of random raster images that preserve autocorrelation of the original maps. Nearly three fourths of the 94 taxa with at least one stem per ha showed a significant correlation between tree density and relative elevation, revealing contrasted species-habitat associations in term of abundance, with seasonally inundated bottomlands (24.5{\%} of species) and well-drained plateaus (48.9{\%} of species). We also observed species preferences for environments with or without steep slopes (13.8{\%} and 10.6{\%}, respectively). We observed that closely-related species were frequently associated with different soil habitats in this region (70{\%} of the 14 genera with congeneric species that have a significant association test) suggesting species-habitat associations have arisen multiple times in this tree community. We also tested if species with similar habitat preferences shared functional strategies. We found that seasonally inundated forest specialists tended to have smaller stature (maximum diameter) than species found on plateaus. Our results underline the importance of tree-soil habitat associations in structuring diverse communities at fine spatial scales and suggest that additional studies are needed to disentangle community assembly mechanisms related to dispersal limitation, biotic interactions and environmental filtering from species-habitat associations. Moreover, they provide a framework to generalize across tropical forest sites.},

Leaf measurements included leaf tissue thickness, stomatal density, trichome density, specific leaf area, leaf density, water relations, and gas exchange. We found considerable genotypic differences between the two cultivars. Chemlali exhibited more tolerance to water stress, with a thicker palisade parenchyma, and a higher stomatal and trichome density. Chemlali leaves also revealed lower specific leaf area and had higher density of foliar tissue and lower reduction in net CO2 assimilation rate. The mechanisms employed by these two cultivars to cope with water deficit are discussed at the morpho-structural level. The morphological and structural characteristics of the leaves are in accordance with physiological observations and contribute to the interpretation of why the olive cv. Chemlali is more drought-tolerant than cv. Chetoui. Furthermore, from the behaviour of Chemlali plants we consider this cultivar very promising for cultivation in semi-arid areas. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Most experimental biodiversity–ecosystem functioning research to date has addressed herbaceous plant communities. Comparably little is known about how forest com- munities will respond to species losses, despite their importance for global biogeochemical cycling. We studied tree species interactions in experimental subtropical tree communities with 33 distinct tree species mixtures and one, two, or four species. Plots were either exposed to natural light levels or shaded. Trees grew rapidly and were intensely competing above ground after 1.5 growing seasons when plots were thinned and the vertical distribution of leaves and wood determined by separating the biomass of harvested trees into 50 cm height increments. Our aim was to analyze effects of species richness in relation to the vertical allocation of leaf biomass and wood, with an emphasis on bipartite competitive interactions among species. Aboveground productivity increased with species richness. The community- level vertical leaf and wood distribution depended on the species composition of communities. Mean height and breadth of species- level vertical leaf and wood distributions did not change with species rich- ness. However, the extra biomass produced by mixtures compared to monocultures of the component species increased when vertical leaf distributions of monocultures were more differ- ent. Decomposition of biodiversity effects with the additive partitioning scheme indicated pos- itive complementarity effects that were higher in light than in shade. Selection effects did not deviate from zero, irrespective of light levels. Vertical leaf distributions shifted apart in mixed stands as consequence of competition- driven phenotypic plasticity, promoting realized com- plementarity. Structural equation models showed that this effect was larger for species that differed more in growth strategies that were characterized by functional traits. In 13 of the 18 investigated two- species mixtures, both species benefitted relative to intraspecific competition in monoculture. In the remaining five pairwise mixtures, the relative yield gain of one species exceeded the relative yield loss of the other species, resulting in a relative yield total (RYT) exceeding 1. Overall, our analysis indicates that richness–productivity relationships are pro- moted by interspecific niche complementarity at early stages of stand development, and that this effect is enhanced by architectural plasticity.},

abstract = {Natural disturbances are the dominant form of forest regeneration and dynamics in unmanaged tropical forests. Monitoring the size distribution of treefall gaps is important to better understand and predict the carbon budget in response to land use and other global changes. In this study, we model the size frequency distribution of natural canopy gaps with a discrete power law distribution. We use a Bayesian framework to introduce and test, using Monte Carlo Markov chain and Kuo-Mallick algorithms, the effect of local physical environment on gap size distribution. We apply our methodological framework to an original light detecting and ranging dataset in which natural forest gaps were delineated over 30 000 ha of unmanaged forest. We highlight strong links between gap size distribution and environment, primarily hydrological conditions and topography, with large gaps being more frequent on floodplains and in wind-exposed areas. In the future, we plan to apply our methodological framework on a larger scale using satellite data. Additionally, although gap size distribution variation is clearly under environmental control, variation in gap size distribution in time should be tested against climate variability.},

abstract = {There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem processes in changing environments, but the mechanisms that underlie this effect are still controversial and poorly understood. Here, we extend mechanistic theory of ecosystem stability in competitive communities to clarify the mechanisms underlying diversity-stability relationships. We first explain why, contrary to a widely held belief, interspecific competition should generally play a destabilising role. We then explore the stabilising effect of differences in species' intrinsic rates of natural increase and provide a synthesis of various potentially stabilising mechanisms. Three main mechanisms are likely to operate in the stabilising effects of biodiversity on ecosystem properties: (1) asynchrony of species' intrinsic responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) differences in the speed at which species respond to perturbations, (3) reduction in the strength of competition. The first two mechanisms involve temporal complementarity between species, while the third results from functional complementarity. Additional potential mechanisms include selection effects, behavioural changes resulting from species interactions and mechanisms arising from trophic or non-trophic interactions and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that mechanistic trait-based approaches are key to predicting the effects of diversity on ecosystem stability and to bringing the old diversity-stability debate to a final resolution.},

Bot. 38: 109-114.A technique for estimating plant water deficits using a relatively inexpensive micrometer to measure leaf thickness was developed. A strong correlation was found between leaf thickness and relative water content (RWC) in Brassica napus, Mirabilis jalapa, Phaseolus vulgaris and Impatiens parviflora. Although leaf thickness at a given RWC varied between plants, it increased linearly with leaf RWC, the rate of change being similar in leaves of plants of the same age and species. Due to this relationship, the construction of a pressure-volume curve makes possible the estimation of leaf water potential. In this case a calibration curve is needed for each population studied or, for the highest accuracy, for each individual. The technique is particularly useful in field conditions where other techniques are not reliable because of difficulties in controlling temperature and where non-destructive measurements are required. {\textcopyright} 1987 Oxford University Press 1987.},

abstract = {Most global hotspots of biodiversity and endemism are in montane regions. One explanation is that montane regions have intrinsically higher speciation rates than lowland regions because complex mountain topography and climate variation facilitate genetic isolation among populations. Here, we ask from an intraspecific perspective whether frog species whose haplotypes are connected by topographically/climatically complex regions display strong genetic isolation (greater scaled genetic distances), compared with species whose haplotypes are connected by less complex regions. We analysed published DNA sequences of several frog species from tropical Central and South America for the mitochondrial cob, cox1 and 16S rRNA genes. Pairwise genetic distances among haplotypes within each species were scaled to the geographic distances between each pair of haplotypes. Topographic complexity was positively correlated with scaled genetic distances, and isolation-by-resistance was supported only in species from more topographically complex regions. This suggests that heterogeneous topographies increase landscape resistance, which in turn favours the appearance of isolation-by-resistance. Moreover, we found that the potential barriers that restrict gene flow within species are more closely related to factors associated with temperature and topography than to precipitation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

In order to initiate historical analyses of such widespread Neotropical trees, we sequenced the nuclear ribosomal spacer (ITS) region of Symphonia globulifera L. f. (Clusiaceae) from populations spanning the Neotropics and western Africa. This rain forest tree has left unmistakable Miocene fossils in Mesoamerica (15.5-18.2 Ma) and in South America ( approximately 15 Ma). Although marine dispersal of S. globulifera is considered improbable, our study establishes three marine dispersal events leading to the colonization of Mesoamerica, the Amazon basin, and the West Indies, thus supporting the paleontological data. Our phylogeographic analysis revealed the spatial extent of the three Neotropical S. globulifera clades, which represent trans-Andes (Mesoamerica+west Ecuador), cis-Andes (Amazonia+Guiana), and the West Indies. Strong phylogeographic structure found among trans-Andean populations of S. globulifera stands in contrast to an absence of ITS nucleotide variation across the Amazon basin and indicates profound regional differences in the demographic history of this rain forest tree. Drawing from these results, we provide a historical biogeographic hypothesis to account for differences in the patterns of beta diversity within Mesoamerican and Amazonian forests.},

abstract = {Plant communities have traditionally been viewed as either a random collection of individuals or as organismal entities. For most ecologists however, neither perspective provides a modern comprehensive view of plant communities, but we have yet to formalize the view that we currently hold. Here, we assert that an explicit re-consideration of formal community theory must incorporate interactions that have recently been prominent in plant ecology, namely facilitation and indirect effects among competitors. These interactions do not suppport the traditional individualistic perspective. We believe that rejecting strict individualistic theory will allow ecologists to better explain variation occurring at different spatial scales, synthesize more general predictive theories of community dynamics, and develop models for community-level responses to global change. Here, we introduce the concept of the integrated community (IC) which proposes that natural plant communities range from highly individualistic to highly interdependent depending on synergism among: (i) stochastic processes, (ii) the abiotic tolerances of species, (iii) positive and negative interactions among plants, and (iv) indirect interactions within and between trophic levels. All of these processes are well accepted by plant ecologists, but no single theory has sought to integrate these different processes into our concept of communities},

abstract = {Adaptation in response to selection on polygenic phenotypes may occur via subtle allele frequencies shifts at many loci. Current population genomic techniques are not well posed to identify such signals. In the past decade, detailed knowledge about the specific loci underlying polygenic traits has begun to emerge from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we combine this knowledge from GWAS with robust population genetic modeling to identify traits that may have been influenced by local adaptation. We exploit the fact that GWAS provide an estimate of the additive effect size of many loci to estimate the mean additive genetic value for a given phenotype across many populations as simple weighted sums of allele frequencies. We use a general model of neutral genetic value drift for an arbitrary number of populations with an arbitrary relatedness structure. Based on this model, we develop methods for detecting unusually strong correlations between genetic values and specific environmental variables, as well as a generalization of [Q(ST)/F(ST)] comparisons to test for over-dispersion of genetic values among populations. Finally we lay out a framework to identify the individual populations or groups of populations that contribute to the signal of overdispersion. These tests have considerably greater power than their single locus equivalents due to the fact that they look for positive covariance between like effect alleles, and also significantly outperform methods that do not account for population structure. We apply our tests to the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP) dataset using GWAS data for height, skin pigmentation, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, and two inflammatory bowel disease datasets. This analysis uncovers a number of putative signals of local adaptation, and we discuss the biological interpretation and caveats of these results.},

abstract = {While various relationships between productivity and biodiversity are found in forests, the processes underlying these relationships remain unclear and theory struggles to coherently explain them. In this work, we analyse diversity–productivity relationships through an examination of forest structure (described by basal area and tree height heterogeneity). We use a new modelling approach, called 'forest factory', which generates various forest stands and calculates their annual productivity (above-ground wood increment). Analysing approximately 300 000 forest stands, we find that mean forest productivity does not increase with species diversity. Instead forest structure emerges as the key variable. Similar patterns can be observed by analysing 5054 forest plots of the German National Forest Inventory. Furthermore, we group the forest stands into nine forest structure classes, in which we find increasing, decreasing, invariant and even bell-shaped relationships between productivity and diversity. In addition, we introduce a new index, called optimal species distribution, which describes the ratio of realized to the maximal possible productivity (by shuffling species identities). The optimal species distribution and forest structure indices explain the obtained productivity values quite well (R 2 between 0.7 and 0.95), whereby the influence of these attributes varies within the nine forest structure classes.},

abstract = {Research over the last 10 years highlights the increasing importance of hybridization between species as a major force structuring the evolution of genomes and potentially providing raw material for adaptation by natural and/or sexual selection. Fueled by research in a few model systems where phenotypic hybrids are easily identified, research into hybridization and introgression (the flow of genes between species) has exploded with the advent of whole-genome sequencing and emerging methods to detect the signature of hybridization at the whole-genome or chromosome level. Amongst these are a general class of methods that utilize patterns of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across a tree as markers of hybridization. These methods have been applied to a variety of genomic systems ranging from butterflies to Neanderthals to detect introgression, however, when employed at a fine genomic scale these methods do not perform well to quantify introgression in small sample windows. We introduce a novel method to detect introgression by combining two widely used statistics: pairwise nucleotide diversity dxy and Patterson's D. The resulting statistic, the distance fraction (df), accounts for genetic distance across possible topologies and is designed to simultaneously detect and quantify introgression. We also relate our new method to the recently published fd and incorporate these statistics into the powerful genomics R-package PopGenome, freely available on GitHub (pievos101/PopGenome) and the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). The supplemental material contains a wide range of simulation studies and a detailed manual how to perform the statistics within the PopGenome framework. We present a new distance based statistic df that avoids the pitfalls of Patterson's D when applied to small genomic regions and accurately quantifies the fraction of introgression (f) for a wide range of simulation scenarios.},

It is also widely recognized that rare species are the first to become extinct following human-induced disturbances. Surprisingly, however, the functional importance of rare species is still poorly understood, particularly in tropical species-rich assemblages where the majority of species are rare, and the rate of species extinction can be high. Here, we investigated the consequences of local and regional extinctions on the functional structure of species assemblages. We used three extensive datasets (stream fish from the Brazilian Amazon, rainforest trees from French Guiana, and birds from the Australian Wet Tropics) and built an integrative measure of species rarity versus commonness, combining local abundance, geographical range, and habitat breadth. Using different scenarios of species loss, we found a disproportionate impact of rare species extinction for the three groups, with significant reductions in levels of functional richness, specialization, and originality of assemblages, which may severely undermine the integrity of ecological processes. The whole breadth of functional abilities within species assemblages, which is disproportionately supported by rare species, is certainly critical in maintaining ecosystems particularly under the ongoing rapid environmental transitions.},

abstract = {Forest growth models are useful tools for investigating the long-term impacts of logging. In this paper, the results of the rain forest growth model FORMIND were assessed by a multicriteria decision analysis. The main processes covered by FORMIND include tree growth, mortality, regeneration and competition. Tree growth is calculated based on a carbon balance approach. Trees compete for light and space; dying large trees fall down and create gaps in the forest. Sixty-four different logging scenarios for an initially undisturbed forest stand at Deramakot (Malaysia) were simulated. The scenarios differ regarding the logging cycle, logging method, cutting limit and logging intensity. We characterise the impacts with four criteria describing the yield, canopy opening and changes in species composition. Multicriteria decision analysis was used for the first time to evaluate the scenarios and identify the efficient ones. Our results plainly show that reduced-impact logging scenarios are more ‘efficient' than the others, since in these scenarios forest damage is minimised without significantly reducing yield. Nevertheless, there is a trade-off between yield and achieving a desired ecological state of logged forest; the ecological state of the logged forests can only be improved by reducing yields and enlarging the logging cycles. Our study also demonstrates that high cutting limits or low logging intensities cannot compensate for the high level of damage caused by conventional logging techniques.},

abstract = {Somatic mutations are common in plants, and they may accumulate and be passed on to gametes. The determinants of somatic mutation accumulation include the intraorganismal selective effect of mutations, the number of cell divisions that separate the zygote from the formation of gametes, and shoot apical meristem structure and branching. Somatic mutations can promote the evolution of diploidy, polyploidy, sexual recombination, outcrossing, clonality, and separate sexes, and they may contribute genetic variability in many other traits. The amplification of beneficial mutations via intraorganismal selection may relax selection to reduce the genomic mutation rate or to protect the germline in plants. The total rate of somatic mutation, the distribution of selective effects and fates in the plant body, and the degree to which the germline is sheltered from somatic mutations are still poorly understood. Our knowledge can be improved through empirical estimates of mutation rates and effects on cell lineages and whole organisms, such as estimates of the reduction in fitness of progeny produced by within- versus between-flower crosses on the same plant, mutation coalescent studies within the canopy, and incorporation of somatic mutation into theoretical models of plant evolutionary genetics.},

Intuitively, one might expect disease-causing variants to cluster into key pathways that drive disease etiology. But for complex traits, association signals tend to be spread across most of the genome—including near many genes without an obvious connection to disease. We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways. We refer to this hypothesis as an “omnigenic” model.},

abstract = {The rates and biological significance of somatic mutations have long been a subject of debate. Somatic mutations in plants are expected to accumulate with vegetative growth and time, yet rates of somatic mutations are unknown for conifers, which can reach exceptional sizes and ages. We investigated somatic mutation rates in the conifer Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) by analyzing a total of 276 Gb of nuclear DNA from the tops and bottoms of 20 old‐growth trees averaging 76 m in height. We estimate a somatic base substitution rate of 2.7 × 10−8 per base pair within a generation. To date, this is one of the highest estimated per‐generation rates of mutation among eukaryotes, indicating that somatic mutations contribute substantially to the total per‐generation mutation rate in conifers. Nevertheless, as the sampled trees are centuries old, the per‐year rate is low in comparison with nontree taxa. We argue that although somatic mutations raise genetic load in conifers, they generate important genetic variation and enable selection both among cell lineages within individual trees and among offspring.},

@article{Herault2007,
abstract = {Both niche and neutral theories have been suggested as potential frameworks for modelling biodiversity. Niche models assume that biological traits represent evolutionary adaptations and define individuals in terms of functional trade-offs. Neutral models assume that all individuals at a single trophic level are functionally equivalent on a per capita basis with respect to their birth, death, dispersal and speciation. The opinion of many researchers is that neutral and niche processes operate simultaneously to generate diversity without knowing how the unification of both models can be achieved. Recently, several theoretical papers have reported evidence on the evolutionary emergence of niche structures shaping the emergence of groups of similar species. In this way, an Emergent Group is defined as a set of species that have a similar functional niche owing to a convergent ecological strategy. Central to the Emergent Group concept are the assumptions of functional equivalence within and of functional divergence between Emergent Groups. Within an Emergent Group, species richness is subject to a zero-sum rule set by the balance between the rate of individual loss and of immigration. Between Emergent Groups, tradeoffs such as seed size/seedling competitivity, investment in reproductive system/investment in vegetative systems or competitive ability/predator invulnerability are cornerstones of the evolutionary divergence. Delineating Emergent Groups amounts to reaching a compromise between maximizing niche differentiation (i.e. maximizing differences in functional tradeoffs) between Emergent Groups and maximizing neutrality within Emergent Groups. Up to now, the Emergent Group concept has been mostly proposed by theoretical scientists but it should be tested by empirical ecologists. The way in which niche and neutral models could be combined provides a profitable opportunity for theoretical and empirical scientists to collaborate fruitfully. {\textcopyright} 2007 R{\"{u}}bel Foundation, ETH Z{\"{u}}rich.},

abstract = {Understanding how drought affects annual tree growth in tropical forests is of crucial importance to predict their response to climate change. Previous studies, mainly led in the Neotropics and in Southeast Asia, have yielded contradictory results which might be explained by differences in species studied, in the tree development stages considered, or by differences in other environmental factors than water availability. Here, we described the growth responses of functional groups of tree species to drought in a Central African semi-deciduous moist forest. Species groups were automatically defined using a finite mixture model, which grouped species according to their growth model parameters. The growth model considered the variation in species response to drought, and the effect of competition for resources and of tree development stage on growth. Groups were further characterized by species functional traits. Nine species groups were identified. They differed in their ability to acquire, use and conserve resources, as suggested by their differences in maximum growth rate, regeneration guild, maximum dbh, wood density and leaf habit. The species were organized along a light requirement gradient that here closely matched a broader continuum of plant strategies for resource use, from slow-growing shade-tolerant conservative species to fast-growing pioneer acquisitive species. Tree growth decreased with drought intensity, and species drought tolerance was found to be related to resource use strategy: slow-growing species using a conservative strategy were the least sensitive to variations in water availability, while fast-growing species using an acquisitive strategy were the most sensitive. Synthesis. Shade-tolerant species, characterized by a low potential growth rate and thus a conservative strategy of resource use, were found to be the least sensitive to drought. This supports the hypothesis of a single axis summarizing multiple traits that represents a general trade-off between the conservation and rapid acquisition of resources.

abstract = {The extent of gene dispersal is a fundamental factor of the population and evolutionary dynamics of tropical tree species, but directly monitoring seed and pollen movement is a difficult task. However, indirect estimates of historical gene dispersal can be obtained from the fine-scale spatial genetic structure of populations at drift-dispersal equilibrium. Using an approach that is based on the slope of the regression of pairwise kinship coefficients on spatial distance and estimates of the effective population density, we compare indirect gene dispersal estimates of sympatric populations of 10 tropical tree species. We re-analysed 26 data sets consisting of mapped allozyme, SSR (simple sequence repeat), RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) or AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) genotypes from two rainforest sites in French Guiana. Gene dispersal estimates were obtained for at least one marker in each species, although the estimation procedure failed under insufficient marker polymorphism, limited sample size, or inappropriate sampling area. Estimates generally suffered low precision and were affected by assumptions regarding the effective population density. Averaging estimates over data sets, the extent of gene dispersal ranged from 150 m to 1200 m according to species. Smaller gene dispersal estimates were obtained in species with heavy diaspores, which are presumably not well dispersed, and in populations with high local adult density. We suggest that limited seed dispersal could indirectly limit effective pollen dispersal by creating higher local tree densities, thereby increasing the positive correlation between pollen and seed dispersal distances. We discuss the potential and limitations of our indirect estimation procedure and suggest guidelines for future studies. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {High biodiversity of forests is not predicted by traditional models, and evidence for trade-offs those models require is limited. High-dimensional regulation (e.g.. N factors to regulate N species) has long been recognized as a possible alternative explanation, but it has not be been seriously pursued, because only a few limiting resources are evident for trees, and analysis of multiple interactions is challenging. We develop a hierarchical model that allows us to synthesize data from long-term, experimental; data sets with processes that control growth, maturation, fecundity, and survival. We allow for uncertainty at all stages and variation among 26 000 individuals and over time, including 268 000 tree years, for dozens of tree species. We estimate population-level parameters that apply at the species level and the interactions among latent states, i.e., the demographic rates for each individual, every year. The former show that the traditional trade-offs used to explain diversity are not present. Demographic rates overlap among species, and they do not show trends consistent with maintenance of diversity by simple mechanisms (negative correlations and limiting similarity). However, estimates of latent states at the level of individuals and years demonstrate that species partition environmental variation. Correlations between responses to variation in time are high for individuals of the same species, but not for individuals of different species. We demonstrate that these relationships are pervasive, providing strong evidence that high-dimensional regulation is critical for biodiversity regulation.},

abstract = {The issue of species delimitation has long been confused with that of species conceptualization, leading to a half century of controversy concerning both the definition of the species category and methods for inferring the boundaries and numbers of species. Alternative species concepts agree in treating existence as a separately evolving metapopulation lineage as the primary defining property of the species category, but they disagree in adopting different properties acquired by lineages during the course of divergence (e.g., intrinsic reproductive isolation, diagnosability, monophyly) as secondary defining properties (secondary species criteria). A unified species concept can be achieved by treating existence as a separately evolving metapopulation lineage as the only necessary property of species and the former secondary species criteria as different lines of evidence (operational criteria) relevant to assessing lineage separation. This unified concept of species has several consequences for species delimitation, including the following: First, the issues of species conceptualization and species delimitation are clearly separated; the former secondary species criteria are no longer considered relevant to species conceptualization but only to species delimitation. Second, all of the properties formerly treated as secondary species criteria are relevant to species delimitation to the extent that they provide evidence of lineage separation. Third, the presence of any one of the properties (if appropriately interpreted) is evidence for the existence of a species, though more properties and thus more lines of evidence are associated with a higher degree of corroboration. Fourth, and perhaps most significantly, a unified species concept shifts emphasis away from the traditional species criteria, encouraging biologists to develop new methods of species delimitation that are not tied to those properties.},

@article{hodgson_is_2011,
abstract = {Background and Aims Specific leaf area (SLA), a key element of the ‘worldwide leaf economics spectrum', is the preferred ‘soft' plant trait for assessing soil fertility. SLA is a function of leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and leaf thickness (LT). The first, LDMC, defines leaf construction costs and can be used instead of SLA. However, LT identifies shade at its lowest extreme and succulence at its highest, and is not related to soil fertility. Why then is SLA more frequently used as a predictor of soil fertility than LDMC? Methods SLA, LDMC and LT were measured and leaf density (LD) estimated for almost 2000 species, and the capacity of LD to predict LDMC was examined, as was the relative contribution of LDMC and LT to the expression of SLA. Subsequently, the relationships between SLA, LDMC and LT with respect to soil fertility and shade were described. Key Results Although LD is strongly related to LDMC, and LDMC and LT each contribute equally to the expression of SLA, the exact relationships differ between ecological groupings. LDMC predicts leaf nitrogen content and soil fertility but, because LT primarily varies with light intensity, SLA increases in response to both increased shade and increased fertility. Conclusions Gradients of soil fertility are frequently also gradients of biomass accumulation with reduced irradiance lower in the canopy. Therefore, SLA, which includes both fertility and shade components, may often discriminate better between communities or treatments than LDMC. However, LDMC should always be the preferred trait for assessing gradients of soil fertility uncoupled from shade. Nevertheless, because leaves multitask, individual leaf traits do not necessarily exhibit exact functional equivalence between species. In consequence, rather than using a single stand-alone predictor, multivariate analyses using several leaf traits is recommended.},

abstract = {Traditionally the relationship between tree diameter and total height in a forest stand is investigated by using linear or non-linear regression models, in which the spatial heterogeneity in the relationship is largely ignored. The objective of this study is to explore and model the spatial variations in the tree diameter-height relationship in an eucalypt stand using geographically weighted regression (GWR). GWR attempts to capture spatial variations by calibrating a multiple regression model fitted at each tree, weighting all neighboring trees by a function of distance from the subject tree. GWR produces a set of parameter estimates and model statistics (e.g. model R2) for each tree in the stand. The results indicate that GWR significantly improves model fitting over ordinary least squares (OLS). The GWR model produces smaller model residuals across diameter classes than the traditional OLS model does. The overall average (0.074) of the model absolute residual from the GWR model is 43{\%} smaller than that (0.129) from the OLS model. Furthermore, the parameter estimates and model statistics of the GWR model can be mapped using visualization tools such as geographical information system (GIS) to illustrate local spatial variations in the regression relationship under study. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Plant functional traits can vary widely as a result of phenotypic plasticity to abiotic conditions. Trait variation may also reflect responses to the identity of neighbours, although not all species are equally responsive to their biotic surroundings. We hypothesized that responses to neighbours are shaped by spatial community patterns and resulting variability in neighbour composition. More precisely, we tested the theoretical prediction that plasticity is most likely to evolve if alternative environments (in this case, different neighbour species) are common and encountered at similar frequencies. We estimated the frequencies of encountering different neighbour species in the field for 27 grassland species and measured the aboveground morphological responses of each species to conspecific vs heterospecific neighbours in a common garden. Responses to neighbour identity were dependent on how frequently the experimental neighbours were encountered by the focal species in their home community, with the greatest plasticity observed in species that encountered both neighbours (conspecific and heterospecific) with high and even frequency. Biotic interactions with neighbouring species can impose selection on plasticity in functional traits, which may feed back through trait divergence and niche differentiation to influence species coexistence and community structure.},

abstract = {Recent research has documented the importance of edaphic factors in determining the habitat associations of tree species in many tropical rain forests, but the underlying mechanisms for edaphic associations are unclear. At Sepilok Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, two main soil types derived from sandstone (ridges) and alluvium (valleys) differ in nutrient and water availability and are characterized by forests differing markedly in species composition, structure, and understory light availability. We use both survey and reciprocal transplants to examine physiological adaptations to differences in light, nutrient, and water availability between these soil types, and test for the importance of resource-use efficiency in determining edaphic specialization. Photosynthetic surveys for congeneric and confamilial pairs (one species per soil type) of edaphic specialists and for generalists common to both soil types show that species specializing on sandstone-derived soil had lower stomatal conductance at a given assimilation rate than those occurring on alluvial soil and also had greater instantaneous and integrated water-use efficiencies. Foliar dark respiration rates per unit photosynthesis were higher for sandstone ridge than alluvial lowland specialists. We suggest that these higher respiration rates are likely due to increases in photosynthetic enzyme concentrations to compensate for lower internal CO2 concentrations resulting from increased stomatal closure. This is supported by lower photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiencies in the sandstone ridge specialists. Generalist species had lower water-use efficiencies than sandstone ridge specialists when growing on the drier, sandy ridgetops, but their nitrogen-use efficiencies did not differ from the species specialized to the more resource-rich alluvial valleys. We varied light environment and soil nutrient availability in a reciprocal transplant experiment involving two specialist species from each soil type. Edaphic specialist species, when grown on the soil type for which they were not specialized, were not capable of acclimatory shifts to achieve similar resource-use efficiencies as species specialized to that soil type. We conclude that divergent water-use strategies are an important mechanism underlying differences in edaphic associations and thus contributing to maintenance of high local tree species diversity in Bornean rain forests.},

abstract = {Comparative functional ecology seeks to understand why and how ecological systems and their components operate differently across environments. Although traditionally used in (semi)-natural situations, its concepts and methods could certainly apply to address key issues in the large variety of agricultural systems encountered across the world. In this review, we present major advances in comparative plant functional ecology that were made possible over the last two decades by the rapid development of a trait-based approach to plant functioning and prospects to apply it in agricultural situations. The strength of this approach is that it enables us to assess the interactions between organisms and their environment simultaneously on a large number of species, a prerequisite to address questions relative to species distribution, community assembly and ecosystem functioning. The trait concept will be first defined, before presenting a conceptual framework to understand the effects of environmental factors on plant community structure and ecosystem properties via plant traits. We will then argue that leading dimensions of variation among species can be captured by some selected traits and show that a combination of three easily measured traits—specific leaf area (the ratio of leaf area to leaf dry mass), plant height and seed mass—enables us to assess how different species use their resources, interact with neighbours and disperse in time and space. The use of traits to address central questions in community ecology will be reviewed next. It will be shown that traits allow us to (1) understand how plant species are sorted according to the nature of environmental gradients, (2) evaluate the relative importance of habitat filtering and limiting similarity in the process of community assembly and (3) quantify two main components of community functional structure, namely, community-weighted means of traits and community functional divergence. The relative impacts of these two components on ecosystem properties will then be discussed in the case of several components of primary productivity, litter decomposition, soil water content and carbon sequestration. There is strong support for the biomass ratio hypothesis, which states that the extent to which the traits of a species affect those ecosystem properties depends on the abundance of this species in the community. Assessing the role of functional divergence among species on ecosystem properties will require major methodological breakthroughs, both in terms of metrics and statistical procedures to be used. In agricultural situations, we show that trait-based approaches have been successfully developed to assess the impacts of management practices on (1) the agronomic value of grasslands and (2) the functional composition and structure of crop weed communities and how these could affect the functioning of the crop. Applications in forestry are still poorly developed, especially in temperate regions where the number of species in managed forest remains relatively low. The last decades of research have led to the constitution of large data sets of plant traits, which remain poorly compatible and accessible. Recent advances in the field of ecoinformatics suggest that major progress could be achieved in this area by using improved metadata standards and advancing trait domain ontologies. Finally, concluding remarks, unanswered questions and directions for research using the functional approach to biodiversity made possible by the use of traits will be discussed in the contexts of ecological and agronomical systems. The latter indeed cover a wide range of environmental conditions and biological diversity, and the prospect for reducing environmental impacts in highly productive, low- diversity systems will certainly imply improving our skills for the management of more diverse systems prone to a trait-based approach as reviewed here.},

abstract = {Modern coexistence theory and contemporary niche theory represent parallel frameworks for understanding the niche's role in species coexistence. Despite increasing prominence and shared goals, their compatibility and complementarity have received little attention. This paucity of overlap not only presents an obstacle to newcomers to the field, but it also precludes further conceptual advances at their interface. Here, we present a synthetic treatment of the two frameworks. We review their main concepts and explore their theoretical and empirical relationship, focusing on how the resource supply ratio, impact niche, and requirement niche of contemporary niche theory translate into the stabilizing and equalizing processes of modern coexistence theory. We show for a general consumer-resource model that varying resource supply ratios reflects an equalizing process; varying impact niche overlap reflects a stabilizing process; and varying requirement niche overlap may be both stabilizing and equalizing, but has no qualitative effect on coexistence. These generalisations provide mechanistic insight into modern coexistence theory, while also clarifying the role of contemporary niche theory's impacts and requirements in mediating coexistence. From an empirical perspective, we recommend a hierarchical approach, in which quantification of the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is used to guide more focused investigation into the underlying niche factors determining species coexistence. Future research that considers alternative assumptions, including different forms of species interaction, spatio-temporal heterogeneity, and priority effects, would facilitate a more complete synthesis of the two frameworks.},

Using three microsatellites, we analysed 534 seeds of 28 open pollinated families and 164 adults at the experimental site 'Paracou' in French Guiana. We observed, compared to other tropical tree species, relatively high values for the effective number of alleles. Significant spatial genetic structure was detected, with trees at distances up to 150 m more genetically similar than expected at random. We estimated parameters of the mating system and gene flow by using the mixed mating model and the TwoGener approach. The estimated multilocus outcrossing rate, tm, was 0.920. A significant level of biparental inbreeding and a high proportion of full-sibs were estimated for the 28 seed arrays. We estimated mean pollen dispersal distances between 27 and 53 m according to the dispersal models used. Although the adult population density of S. globulifera in Paracou was relatively high, the joint estimation of pollen dispersal and density of reproductive trees gave effective density estimates of 1.6 and 1.3 trees/ha. The parameters of the mating system and gene flow are discussed in the context of spatial genetic and demographic structures, flowering phenology and pollinator composition and behaviour.},

abstract = {Current theoretical studies on mechanisms promoting species co-existence in diverse communities assume that species are fixed in their mating behavior. Each species is a discrete evolutionary unit, even though most empirical evidence indicates that inter-specific gene flow occurs in plant and animal groups. Here, in a data-driven meta-community model of species co-existence, we allow mating behavior to respond to local species composition and abundance. While individuals primarily out-cross, species maintain a diminished capacity for selfing and hybridization. Mate choice is treated as a variable behavior, which responds to intrinsic traits determining mate choice and the density and availability of sympatric inter-fertile individuals. When mate choice is strongly limited, even low survivorship of selfed offspring can prevent extinction of rare species. With increasing mate choice, low hybridization success rates maintain community level diversity for extended periods of time. In high diversity tropical tree communities, competition among sympatric congeneric species is negligible, because direct spatial proximity with close relatives is infrequent. Therefore, the genomic donorship presents little cost. By incorporating variable mating behavior into evolutionary models of diversification, we also discuss how participation in a syngameon may be selectively advantageous. We view this behavior as a genomic mutualism, where maintenance of genomic structure and diminished inter-fertility, allows each species in the syngameon to benefit from a greater effective population size during episodes of selective disadvantage. Rare species would play a particularly important role in these syngameons as they are more likely to produce heterospecific crosses and transgressive phenotypes. We propose that inter-specific gene flow can play a critical role by allowing genomic mutualists to avoid extinction and gain local adaptations.},

abstract = {How numerous tree species can coexist in diverse forest communities is a key question in community ecology.Whereas neutral theory assumes that species are adapted to common field conditions and coexist by chance, niche theory predicts that species are functionally different and coexist because they are specialized for different niches. We integrated biophysical principles into a mathematical plant model to determine whether and how functional plant traits and trade-offs may cause functional divergence and niche separation of tree species. We used this model to compare the carbon budget of saplings across 13 co-occurring dry-forest tree species along gradients of light and water availability. We found that species ranged in strategy, fromacquisitive species with high carbon budgets at highest resource levels tomore conservative species with high tolerances for both shade and drought. The crown leaf area index and nitrogen mass per leaf area drove the functional divergence along the simulated light gradient, which was consistent with observed species distributions along light gradients in the forest. Stomatal coordination to avoid low water potentials or hydraulic failure caused functional divergence along the simulated water gradient, but was not correlated to observed species distributions along the water gradient in the forest. The trait-based biophysical model thus explains how functional traits cause functional divergence across species and whether such divergence contributes to niche separation along resource gradients.},

abstract = {The role of natural selection in shaping patterns of diversity is still poorly understood in the Neotropics. We carried out the first genome-wide population genomics study in a Neotropical tree, Handroanthus impetiginosus (Bignoniaceae), sampling 75,838 SNPs by sequence capture in 128 individuals across 13 populations. We found evidences for local adaptation using Bayesian correlations of allele frequency and environmental variables (32 loci in 27 genes) complemented by an analysis of selective sweeps and genetic hitchhiking events using SweepFinder2 (81 loci in 47 genes). Fifteen genes were identified by both approaches. By accounting for population genetic structure, we also found 14 loci with selection signal in a STRUCTURE-defined lineage comprising individuals from five populations, using Outflank. All approaches pinpointed highly diverse and structurally conserved genes affecting plant development and primary metabolic processes. Spatial interpolation forecasted differences in the expected allele frequencies at loci under selection over time, suggesting that H. impetiginosus may track its habitat during climate changes. However, local adaptation through natural selection may also take place, allowing species persistence due to niche evolution. A high genetic differentiation was seen among the H. impetiginosus populations, which, together with the limited power of the experiment, constrains the improved detection of other types of soft selective forces, such as background, balanced, and purifying selection. Small differences in allele frequency distribution among widespread populations and the low number of loci with detectable adaptive sweeps advocate for a polygenic model of adaptation involving a potentially large number of small genome-wide effects.},

abstract = {Loci involved in local adaptation can potentially be identified by an unusual correlation between allele frequencies and important ecological variables or by extreme allele frequency differences between geographic regions. However, such comparisons are complicated by differences in sample sizes and the neutral correlation of allele frequencies across populations due to shared history and gene flow. To overcome these difficulties, we have developed a Bayesian method that estimates the empirical pattern of covariance in allele frequencies between populations from a set of markers and then uses this as a null model for a test at individual SNPs. In our model the sample frequencies of an allele across populations are drawn from a set of underlying population frequencies; a transform of these population frequencies is assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution. We first estimate the covariance matrix of this multivariate normal across loci using a Monte Carlo Markov chain. At each SNP, we then provide a measure of the support, a Bayes factor, for a model where an environmental variable has a linear effect on the transformed allele frequencies compared to a model given by the covariance matrix alone. This test is shown through power simulations to outperform existing correlation tests. We also demonstrate that our method can be used to identify SNPs with unusually large allele frequency differentiation and offers a powerful alternative to tests based on pairwise or global FST.

abstract = {Molecular ecology regularly requires the analysis of count data that reflect the relative abundance of features of a composition (e.g., taxa in a community, gene transcripts in a tissue). The sampling process that generates these data can be modelled using the multinomial distribution. Replicate multinomial samples inform the relative abundances of features in an underlying Dirichlet distribution. These distributions together form a hierarchical model for relative abundances among replicates and sampling groups. This type of Dirichlet-multinomial modelling (DMM) has been described previously, but its benefits and limitations are largely untested. With simulated data, we quantified the ability of DMM to detect differences in proportions between treatment and control groups, and compared the efficacy of three computational methods to implement DMM—Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), variational inference (VI), and Gibbs Markov chain Monte Carlo. We report that DMM was better able to detect shifts in relative abundances than analogous analytical tools, while identifying an acceptably low number of false positives. Among methods for implementing DMM, HMC provided the most accurate estimates of relative abundances, and VI was the most computationally efficient. The sensitivity of DMM was exemplified through analysis of previously published data describing lung microbiomes. We report that DMM identified several potentially pathogenic, bacterial taxa as more abundant in the lungs of children who aspirated foreign material during swallowing; these differences went undetected with different statistical approaches. Our results suggest that DMM has strong potential as a statistical method to guide inference in molecular ecology.},

Here, we investigate patterns of hybridization in vascular plants. Our dataset included 282 families, 3212 genera and ≈37,000 species accounts from eight regional floras covering continental Europe, two island regions, and parts of North America and Australia. Interspecific hybrids were common in the wild, occurring in 40{\%} of families and 16{\%} of genera, with an overall frequency of 0.09 hybrids per nonhybrid species. Taxon species richness explained a large amount of variation in the number of hybrids, but taxon bias (study effort) did not. We accounted for species richness in calculating hybridization propensities, and found that both families and genera differed in hybridization propensity. Hybridization propensity of a given group was generally consistent across regions (with the exception of Hawaii), suggesting that hybridization behavior may be determined more by intrinsic properties of a group than by environmental conditions. We found evidence of a strong phylogenetic signal ($\lambda$=0.93) in hybridization propensity as hybrids were not uniformly distributed across orders of vascular plants. Characterization of the hybridization behavior of groups should lead to increased predictive power regarding their traits and evolutionary trajectories, and will allow comparative tests of the traits driving differences in hybridization propensity. {\textcopyright} 2010 R{\"{u}}bel Foundation, ETH Z{\"{u}}rich.},

abstract = {Practitioners and decision-makers need information on how to conserve mixed Fir and Spruce forests in mountains. To answer this question, we modelled demographic (growth, mortality, recruitment) and allometric functions from field data for the two species. These functions have been implemented in a forest dynamics model to improve the knowledge on natural dynamics of the two species and to test for silvicultural practices. Parameter estimation was performed within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Estimation permitted to quantify and underline species differences : Fir, the relatively shade-tolerant species compared to Spruce, was less sensitive to self-thinning, had a higher growth and a higher probability of recruitment at low light than Spruce. Models took into account observation errors and spatio-temporal process variability. Individual variability (or so-called intra-specific variability) and temporal variability (interannual and intraindividual variability) were significant and tended to equalize species fitness, inverting species hierarchy locally in space or sporadically in time. First simulations with simulator Samsara2 showed a better behavior of the model when including process variability. Variability led to patterns for stand structuration (tree heights and diameters) and to patterns for basal-area evolution with time which were much more realistic than without variability. Running simulations on a mixed Fir and Spruce stand, we observed a competitive exclusion of Spruce by Fir. Equalizing mechanisms associated to variability were not able to blur the competitive advantage of Fir on Spruce. Nevertheless, transient dynamics of the system was slow and apparent coexistence of the two species lasted for several hundred years.},

abstract = {We consider applying Bayesian Variable Selection Regression, or BVSR, to genome-wide association studies and similar large-scale regression problems. Currently, typical genome-wide association studies measure hundreds of thousands, or millions, of genetic variants (SNPs), in thousands or tens of thousands of individuals, and attempt to identify regions harboring SNPs that affect some phenotype or outcome of interest. This goal can naturally be cast as a variable selection regression problem, with the SNPs as the covariates in the regression. Characteristic features of genome-wide association studies include the following: (i) a focus primarily on identifying relevant variables, rather than on prediction; and (ii) many relevant covariates may have tiny effects, making it effectively impossible to confidently identify the complete "correct" subset of variables. Taken together, these factors put a premium on having interpretable measures of confidence for individual covariates being included in the model, which we argue is a strength of BVSR compared with alternatives such as penalized regression methods. Here we focus primarily on analysis of quantitative phenotypes, and on appropriate prior specification for BVSR in this setting, emphasizing the idea of considering what the priors imply about the total proportion of variance in outcome explained by relevant covariates. We also emphasize the potential for BVSR to estimate this proportion of variance explained, and hence shed light on the issue of "missing heritability" in genome-wide association studies.},

Although recent studies have improved our understanding of adaptive introgression in widely distributed tree species, little is known about the dynamics of this process in populations at the margins of species ranges. We investigated the extent of introgression between three species of the genus Populus sect. Tacamahaca (P. balsamifera, P. angustifolia and P. trichocarpa) at the margins of their distributions in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States and Canada. Using genotyping by sequencing (GBS), we analysed {\~{}} 83,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in 296 individuals from 29 allopatric and sympatric populations of the three species. We found a trispecies hybrid complex present throughout the zone of range overlap, including early as well as advanced generation backcross hybrids, indicating recurrent gene flow in this hybrid complex. Using genomic cline analysis, we found evidence of non-neutral patterns of introgression at 23{\%} of loci in hybrids, of which 47{\%} and 8{\%} represented excess ancestry from P. angustifolia and P. balsamifera, respectively. Gene ontology analysis suggested these genomic regions were enriched for genes associated with photoperiodic regulation, metal ion transport, maintenance of redox homeostasis and cell wall metabolites involved in regulation of seasonal dormancy. Our study demonstrates the role of adaptive introgression in a multispecies hybrid complex in range-edge populations and has implications for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of adaptation in hybrid zones, especially at the margins of species distributions.},

A recent study has suggested that “index switching,” where reads are misattributed to the wrong sample, may be higher in new versions of the HiSeq platform. This has the potential to invalidate both published and in-progress work across the field. Here, we test for evidence of index switching in an exemplar whole-genome shotgun data set sequenced on both the Illumina HiSeq 2500, which should not have the problem, and the Illumina HiSeq X, which may. We leverage unbalanced heterozygotes, which may be produced by index switching, and ask whether the undersequenced allele is more likely to be found in other samples in the same lane than expected based on the allele frequency. Although we validate the sensitivity of this method using simulations, we find that neither the HiSeq 2500 nor the HiSeq X has evidence of index switching. This suggests that, thankfully, index switching may not be a ubiquitous problem in HiSeq X sequence data. Lastly, we provide scripts for applying our method so that index switching can be tested for in other data sets.},

Over the last three decades, developments in community and ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term “trait” itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the “performance paradigm” to plant ecology. “Functional traits” are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing “integration functions” which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.},

To this end models have been developed to simulate rainforest dynamics and to allow optional management strategies to be evaluated. Parameterisation of presently existing models for a certain site needs a lot of work, thus the parameterisation effort is too high to apply the models to a wide range of rainforests. Hence, in this paper we introduce the simplified model FORREG using the knowledge we have gained from a more complex model, FORMIX3-Q. The FORREG model uses differential equations to determine the volume growth of three successional species groups. Parameterisation is simplified by a genetic algorithm, which determines the required internal model parameters from characteristics of the forest dynamics. The new model is employed to assess the sustainability of various logging policies in terms of yield and damage. Results for three forests are discussed: (1) the tropical lowland rain forest in the Deramakot Forest Reserve, (2) the Lambir National Park in Malaysia and (3) a subtropical forest in Paraguay. Our model reproduces both undisturbed forest dynamics and dynamics of logged forests simulated with FORMIX3-Q very well. However, the resultant volumes of yield and damage differ slightly from those gained by FORMIX3-Q if short logging cycles are simulated. Choosing longer logging cycles leads to a good correspondence of both models. For the Deramakot Forest Reserve different logging cycles are compared and discussed.},

abstract = {Both habitat filtering and dispersal limitation influence the compositional structure of forest communities, but previous studies examining the relative contributions of these processes with variation partitioning have primarily used topography to represent the influence of the environment. Here, we bring together data on both topography and soil resource variation within eight large (24-50 ha) tropical forest plots, and use variation partitioning to decompose community compositional variation into fractions explained by spatial, soil resource and topographic variables. Both soil resources and topography account for significant and approximately equal variation in tree community composition (9-34{\%} and 5-29{\%}, respectively), and all environmental variables together explain 13-39{\%} of compositional variation within a plot. A large fraction of variation (19-37{\%}) was spatially structured, yet unexplained by the environment, suggesting an important role for dispersal processes and unmeasured environmental variables. For the majority of sites, adding soil resource variables to topography nearly doubled the inferred role of habitat filtering, accounting for variation in compositional structure that would previously have been attributable to dispersal. Our results, illustrated using a new graphical depiction of community structure within these plots, demonstrate the importance of small-scale environmental variation in shaping local community structure in diverse tropical forests around the globe. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

@article{hubbell_unified_1997,
abstract = {. Theories of island biogeography and of relative species abundance are of central importance in biogeography and community ecology, yet these two bodies of theory heretofore have been largely unconnected. Incorporating speciation into the theory of island biogeography unexpectedly results in unification of these two theories. The unified theory predicts the existence of a fundamental biodiversity number $\theta$ that controls not only species richness, but also relative species abundance in the source area metacommunity at equilibrium between speciation and extinction. With additional parameters for island size and migration rate, the theory also predicts relative species abundance on islands or local regions of continuous landscapes. Application of the theory to the biogeography and biodiversity of communities of tropical trees and reef-building corals are discussed. One important result is that only relatively modest migration rates are sufficient to dynamically couple the regional metacommunity and stabilize community structure on large spatiotemporal scales. Thus, regional, long-term compositional stasis in tropical rain forests and coral reefs can arise just as easily from the stabilizing effect of large numbers as from niche-assembly rules that limit species membership in communities. Because of the higher intrinsic vagility of corals, the theory predicts greater regional similarity in coral reef communities than in tropical tree communities.},

@article{Taylor2006,
abstract = {Historically, six small lakes in southwestern British Columbia each contained a sympatric species pair of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). These pairs consisted of a 'benthic' and 'limnetic' species that had arisen postglacially and, in four of the lakes, independently. Sympatric sticklebacks are considered biological species because they are morphologically, ecologically and genetically distinct and because they are strongly reproductively isolated from one another. The restricted range of the species pairs places them at risk of extinction, and one of the pairs has gone extinct after the introduction of an exotic catfish. In another lake, Enos Lake, southeastern Vancouver Island, an earlier report suggested that its species pair is at risk from elevated levels of hybridization. We conducted a detailed morphological analysis, as well as genetic analysis of variation at five microsatellite loci for samples spanning a time frame of 1977 to 2002 to test the hypothesis that the pair in Enos Lake is collapsing into a hybrid swarm. Our morphological analysis showed a clear breakdown between benthics and limnetics. Bayesian model-based clustering indicated that two morphological clusters were evident in 1977 and 1988, which were replaced by 1997 by a single highly variable cluster. The most recent 2000 and 2002 samples confirm the breakdown. Microsatellite analysis corroborated the morphological results. Bayesian analyses of population structure in a sample collected in 1994 indicated two genetically distinct populations in Enos Lake, but only a single genetic population was evident in 1997, 2000, and 2002. In addition, genetic analyses of samples collected in 1997, 2000, and 2002 showed strong signals of 'hybrids'; they were genetically intermediate to parental genotypes. Our results support the idea that the Enos Lake species pair is collapsing into a hybrid swarm. Although the precise mechanism(s) responsible for elevated hybridization in the lake is unknown, the demise of the Enos Lake species pair follows the appearance of an exotic crayfish, Pascifasticus lenisculus, in the early 1990s. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Vincenzi2014,
abstract = {Wildfire frequency and intensity in the Mediterranean region are predicted to increase with climate and anthropogenic changes in the following decades. Pines species often posses fire-embracing and fire-avoiding strategies that increase the probability of persistence and performance in fire-prone habitats. One such strategy is serotiny, i.e., the capacity to retain seeds in long-closed cones within the plant canopy; serotinous cones release seeds only when either a fire or a heat shock occurs. In this work, we used a simulation approach and Pinus pinaster populations as a model system to investigate how (i) an increased frequency of fire, (ii) genetic characteristics of serotiny, and (iii) observed differences in life histories interact to determine (a) risk of local population extinction and (b) temporal changes in the prevalence of serotiny in the modeled population. In addition, we tested whether the contemporary evolution of serotiny in the face of increased probability of occurrence of fires increased the probability of population persistence with respect to a scenario in which serotiny was not allowed to evolve. Our simulations showed that over the 300 years of simulated time, the evolution of serotiny did not substantially contribute to the persistence of populations. Extinction risk increased with the increasing probability of occurrence of fire and slightly decreased with (i) higher gene flow from outside the modeled population, and (ii) higher prevalence of serotiny at the beginning of the simulation. The prevalence of serotiny at the end of simulation time was difficult to predict and mostly driven by stochasticity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {In recent times, the science of ecology has been rejuvenated and has moved to a central position in biology. This volume contains eighteen original, major contributions by leaders in the field, all associates of the late Robert MacArthur, whose work has stimulated many of the recent developments in ecology. The intellectual ferment of the field is reflected in these papers, which offer new models for ecological processes, new applications of theoretical and quantitative techniques, and new methods for analyzing and interpreting a wide variety of empirical data.The first five chapters explore the evolution of species abundance and diversity (R. Levins, E. Leigh, J. MacArthur, R. May, and M. Rosenzweig). The theory of loop analysis is newly applied to understanding stability of species communities under both mendelian and group selection. Species abundance relations, population fluctuations, and continental patterns of species diversity are illustrated and interpreted theoretically. The next section examines the competitive strategies of optimal resource allocation variously employed in plant life histories (W. Schaffer and M. Gadgil), bird diets and foraging techniques (H. Hespenheide), butterfly seasonal flights (A. Shapiro), and forest succession examined by the theory of Markov processes (H. Horn).The seven chapters of the third section study the structure of species communities, by comparing different natural communities in similar habitats (M. Cody, J. Karr and F. James, E. Pianka, J. Brown, J. Diamond), or by manipulating field situations experimentally (R. Patrick, J. Connell). The analyses are of communities of species as diverse as freshwater stream organisms, desert lizards and rodents, birds, invertebrates, and plants. These studies yield insights into the assembly of continental and insular communities, convergent evolution of morphology and of ecological structure, and the relative roles of predation, competition, and harsh physical conditions in limiting species ranges.Finally, the two remaining chapters illustrate how ecological advances depend on interaction of theory with field and laboratory observations (G. E. Hutchinson), and how ecological studies such as those of this volume may find practical application to conservation problems posed by man's accelerating modification of the natural world (E. Wilson and E. Willis).},

abstract = {Successful growth of a tree is the result of combined effects of biotic and abiotic factors. It is important to understand how biotic and abiotic factors affect changes in forest structure and dynamics under environmental fluctuations. In this study, we explored the effects of initial size [diameter at breast height (DBH)], neighborhood competition, and site condition on tree growth, based on a 3-year monitoring of tree growth rate in a permanent plot (120 × 80 m) of montane Fagus engleriana–Cyclobalanopsis multiervis mixed forest on Mt. Shennongjia, China. We measured DBH increments every 6 months from October 2011 to October 2014 by field-made dendrometers and calculated the mean annual growth rate over the 3 years for each individual tree. We also measured and calculated twelve soil properties and five topographic variables for 384 grids of 5 × 5 m. We defined two distance-dependent neighborhood competition indices with and without considerations of phylogenetic relatedness between trees and tested for significant differences in growth rates among functional groups. On average, trees in this mixed montane forest grew 0.07 cm year−1 in DBH. Deciduous, canopy, and early-successional species grew faster than evergreen, small-statured, and late-successional species, respectively. Growth rates increased with initial DBH, but were not significantly related to neighborhood competition and site condition for overall trees. Phylogenetic relatedness between trees did not influence the neighborhood competition. Different factors were found to influence tree growth rates of different functional groups: Initial DBH was the dominant factor for all tree groups; neighborhood competition within 5 m radius decreased growth rates of evergreen trees; and site condition tended to be more related to growth rates of fast-growing trees (deciduous, canopy, pioneer, and early-successional species) than the slow-growing trees (evergreen, understory, and late-successional species).},

abstract = {The potential of low viscosity silicone-based impression material for measuring stomatal aperture on intact leaves was investigated. It was found that the probability of successful replication of Commelina communis L. stomata depended on the width of the stomatal pores. The wider pores in a sample were more likely to be measured, so the resulting estimated mean was an overestimate of the true mean. This bias in estimates of stomatal aperture from impressions was studied and quantified. A transformation is described which was used to adjust apparent aperture measurements from impressions to give more accurate estimates of stomatal apertures on intact leaves of C. communis. Maximum absolute errors due to the bias usually occurred at apparent apertures on impressions of between 2 and 5 $\mu$m but were proportionally greatest below 3$\mu$m, where they often exceeded 40{\%}. At a given aperture, the error depended upon the dispersion of the stomatal apertures about their mean and was greatest when this was large.},

We resolved the sequences of relative water content (RWC) and leaf water potential ($\Psi$leaf) thresholds of functional impairment. • On average, losses of leaf rehydration capacity occurred at dehydration beyond 50{\%} declines of gs, Kleaf and turgor loss point. Losses of Fv/Fm occurred after much stronger dehydration and were not recovered with leaf rehydration. Across species, tissue dehydration thresholds were inter-correlated, suggesting trait co-selection. Thresholds for each type of functional decline were much less variable across species in terms of RWC than $\Psi$leaf. • The stomatal and leaf hydraulic systems show early functional declines before cell integrity is lost. Substantial damage to the photochemical apparatus occurs at extreme dehydration, after complete stomatal closure, and seems to be irreversible.},

abstract = {Understanding the relationship between diversity and stability requires a knowledge of how species interact with each other and how each is affected by the environment. The relationship is also complex, because the concept of stability is multifaceted; different types of stability describing different properties of ecosystems lead to multiple diversity-stability relationships. A growing number of empirical studies demonstrate positive diversity-stability relationships. These studies, however, have emphasized only a few types of stability, and they rarely uncover the mechanisms responsible for stability. Because anthropogenic changes often affect stability and diversity simultaneously, diversity-stability relationships cannot be understood outside the context of the environmental drivers affecting both. This shifts attention away from diversity-stability relationships toward the multiple factors, including diversity, that dictate the stability of ecosystems.},

Here, we tested the individual?based trait approach in a hyperdiverse Amazonian tropical rainforest and evaluated intraspecific variation in trait values, plant strategies at the individual level, and whether traits are functional and predict individual performance. We evaluated {\textgreater} 1300 tree saplings belonging to {\textgreater} 383 species, measured 25 traits related to growth and defense, and evaluated the effects of environmental conditions, plant size, and traits on stem growth. A total of 44{\%} of the trait variation was observed within species, indicating a strong potential for acclimation. Individuals showed two strategy spectra, related to tissue toughness and organ size vs leaf display. In this nutrient? and light?limited forest, traits measured at the individual level were surprisingly poor predictors of individual growth performance because of convergence of traits and growth rates. Functional trait approaches based on individuals or species are conceptually fundamentally different: the species?based approach focuses on the potential and the individual?based approach on the realized traits and growth rates. Counterintuitively, the individual approach leads to a poor prediction of individual performance, although it provides a more realistic view on community dynamics.},

A distinction is made [following Dobzhansky (1969) and Harper (1982)] between adaptive, defined as conferring a benefit on the organism with regard to its present relationship with its environment, and adapted, which describes a character that is thought to be the product of natural selection over previous generations—i.e., which was adaptive in the past and was therefore fixed by natural selection. “Adapted” refers to the causal origin of the character in evolutionary history; “adaptive” says nothing about the origin of the trait, but merely describes its present value in a given environment.},

Interspecific differences in the homographic model parameters explain less than 7{\%} of the variation in chlorophyll content in our data set.

Here, as part of the One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative, we sequenced the vegetative transcriptomes of 1,124 species that span the diversity of plants in a broad sense (Archaeplastida), including green plants (Viridiplantae), glaucophytes (Glaucophyta) and red algae (Rhodophyta). Our analysis provides a robust phylogenomic framework for examining the evolution of green plants. Most inferred species relationships are well supported across multiple species tree and supermatrix analyses, but discordance among plastid and nuclear gene trees at a few important nodes highlights the complexity of plant genome evolution, including polyploidy, periods of rapid speciation, and extinction. Incomplete sorting of ancestral variation, polyploidization and massive expansions of gene families punctuate the evolutionary history of green plants. Notably, we find that large expansions of gene families preceded the origins of green plants, land plants and vascular plants, whereas whole-genome duplications are inferred to have occurred repeatedly throughout the evolution of flowering plants and ferns. The increasing availability of high-quality plant genome sequences and advances in functional genomics are enabling research on genome evolution across the green tree of life.},

abstract = {Understanding how species assemblages are structured in relation to environmental variation is a central issue in community ecology. However, factors that create regional variation in relative species abundances have been little studied due to the rarity of large-scale datasets. Here, we investigated a large dataset (30 180 0.5-ha plots spread over 1 600 000 ha) gathered from forest planning inventories in the semi-deciduous forest of the south western Central African Republic. We used Correspondence Analysis and Non-Symmetric Correspondence Analysis on Instrumental Variables to analyse variation in the abundance of 73 common tree species in relation to soil type, rainfall and proximity to villages. Together, environmental variables explained 10.3{\%} of multi-species floristic variation among plots, and the regional spatial structure almost disappeared when the effects of these variables were removed. A Trend Surface Analysis using a third order polynomial function of the geographical coordinates of the plots explained 14.5{\%} of the floristic variation and more than 75{\%} of this variation was explained by environmental variables. Sandy soil was the most influential factor affecting floristic composition. Residual spatial variation not explained by the environmental variables probably reflects the natural and anthropogenic history of the vegetation.},

abstract = {Background: Understanding the genetic and environmental mechanisms governing variation in morphology or phenology in wild populations is currently an important challenge. While there is a general consensus that selection is stronger under stressful conditions, it remains unclear whether the evolutionary potential of traits should increase or decrease with increasingly stressful conditions. Here, we investigate how contrasting environmental conditions during growth may affect the maternal and genetic components of body mass in roe deer, the most abundant and widespread wild ungulate in Western Europe. Body mass is a key life history trait that strongly influences both survival and reproductive performance in large herbivores. We used pedigrees and animal models to determine the variance components of juvenile and adult winter body mass in two populations experiencing contrasting early-life conditions. Results: Our analyses showed that roe deer at Chiz{\'{e}}, where habitat was poor and unpredictable, exhibited very low genetic variance in juvenile body mass. Instead, variance in mass was mainly driven by among-cohort differences in early-life conditions and maternal environment. In contrast, roe deer at Bogesund, where resource availability during the critical period of fawn rearing was higher, displayed a substantial level of genetic variance in body mass. We discuss the potential role of past demography and viability selection on fawn body mass on the erosion of genetic variance in the poor habitat. Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of accounting for both spatial (i.e. between-population variation) and temporal (i.e. cohort variation) heterogeneity in environmental conditions, especially in early life, to understand the potential for adaptive responses of wild populations to selection.},

abstract = {Ecological speciation requires divergent selection, reproductive isolation and a genetic mechanism to link the two. We examined the role of gene expression and coding sequence evolution in this process using two species of Howea palms that have diverged sympatrically on Lord Howe Island, Australia. These palms are associated with distinct soil types and have displaced flowering times, representing an ideal candidate for ecological speciation. We generated large amounts of RNA-Seq data from multiple individuals and tissue types collected on the island from each of the two species. We found that differentially expressed loci as well as those with divergent coding sequences between Howea species were associated with known ecological and phenotypic differences, including response to salinity, drought, pH and flowering time. From these loci, we identified potential ecological speciation genes' and further validate their effect on flowering time by knocking out orthologous loci in a model plant species. Finally, we put forward six plausible ecological speciation loci, providing support for the hypothesis that pleiotropy could help to overcome the antagonism between selection and recombination during speciation with gene flow.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic patterns and the underlying speciation processes can be deduced from morphological, functional, and ecological patterns of species similarity and divergence. In some cases, though, species retain multiple similarities and remain almost indistinguishable; in other cases, evolutionary convergence can make such patterns misleading; very often in such cases, the “true” picture only emerges from carefully built molecular phylogenies, which may come with major surprises. In addition, closely related species may experience gene flow after divergence, thus potentially blurring species delimitation. By means of advanced inferential methods, we studied molecular divergence between species of the Virola genus (Myristicaceae): widespread Virola michelii and recently described, endemic V. kwatae, using widespread V. surinamensis as a more distantly related outgroup with different ecology and morphology—although with overlapping range. Contrary to expectations, we found that the latter, and not V. michelii, was sister to V. kwatae. Therefore, V. kwatae probably diverged from V. surinamensis through a recent morphological and ecological shift, which brought it close to distantly related V. michelii. Through the modeling of the divergence process, we inferred that gene flow between V. surinamensis and V. kwatae stopped soon after their divergence and resumed later, in a classical secondary contact event which did not erase their ecological and morphological differences. While we cannot exclude that initial divergence occurred in allopatry, current species distribution and the absence of geographical barriers make complete isolation during speciation unlikely. We tentatively conclude that (a) it is possible that divergence occurred in allopatry/parapatry and (b) secondary contact did not suppress divergence.},

abstract = {In the Bonin Islands of the western Pacific where the light environment is characterized by high fluctuations due to frequent typhoon disturbance, we hypothesized that the invasive success of Bischofia javanica Blume (invasive tree, mid-successional) may be attributable to a high acclimation capacity under fluctuating light availability. The physiological and morphological responses of B. javanica to both simulated canopy opening and closure were compared against three native species of different successional status: Trema orientalis Blume (pioneer), Schima mertensiana (Sieb. et Zucc.) Koidz (mid-successional) and Elaeocarpus photiniaefolius Hook.et Arn (late-successional). The results revealed significant species-specific differences in the timing of physiological maturity and phenotypic plasticity in leaves developed under constant high and low light levels. For example, the photosynthetic capacity of T. orientalis reached a maximum in leaves that had just fully expanded when grown under constant high light (50{\%} of full sun) whereas that of E. photiniaefolius leaves continued to increase until 50 d after full expansion. For leaves that had just reached full expansion, T. orientalis, having high photosynthetic plasticity between high and low light, exhibited low acclimation capacity under the changing light (from high to low or low to high light). In comparison with native species, B. javanica showed a higher degree of physiological and morphological acclimation following transfer to a new light condition in leaves of all age classes (i.e. before and after reaching full expansion). The high acclimation ability of B. javanica in response to changes in light availability may be a part of its pre-adaptations for invasiveness in the fluctuating environment of the Bonin Islands.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Calibration of terrestrial ecosystem models is important but challenging. Bayesian inference implemented by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling provides a comprehensive framework to estimate model parameters and associated uncertainties using their posterior distributions. The effectiveness and efficiency of the method strongly depend on the MCMC algorithm used. In this study, a Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm was used to estimate posterior distributions of 21 parameters for the data assimilation linked ecosystem carbon (DALEC) model using 14 years of daily net ecosystem exchange data collected at the Harvard Forest Environmental Measurement Site eddy-flux tower. The DREAM is a multi-chain method and uses differential evolution technique for chain movement, allowing it to be efficiently applied to high-dimensional problems, and can reliably estimate heavy-tailed and multimodal distributions that are difficult for single-chain schemes using a Gaussian proposal distribution. The results were evaluated against the popular Adaptive Metropolis (AM) scheme. DREAM indicated that two parameters controlling autumn phenology have multiple modes in their posterior distributions while AM only identified one mode. The calibration of DREAM resulted in a better model fit and predictive performance compared to the AM. DREAM provides means for a good exploration of the posterior distributions of model parameters. It reduces the risk of false convergence to a local optimum and potentially improves the predictive performance of the calibrated model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

By using a hierarchical model of survival for more than 30,000 seedlings of 180 tropical tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we tested whether species' sensitivity to neighboring individuals relates to their relative abundance in the community. We found wide variation among species in the effect of conspecific, but not heterospedfic, neighbors on survival, and we found a significant relationship between the strength of conspecific neighbor effects and species abundance. Specifically, rare species suffered more from the presence of conspecific neighbors than common species did, suggesting that conspecific density dependence shapes species abundances in diverse communities.},

With data analysis and theory, we found a simple and biologically intuitive hypothesis to explain this property, which is the foundation of forest dynamics modeling and carbon storage estimates. After a disturbance, new individuals in the forest gap grow quickly in full sun until they begin to overtop one another. The two-dimensional space-filling of the growing crowns of the tallest individuals relegates a group of losing, slow-growing individuals to the understory. Those left in the understory follow a power-law size distribution, the scaling of which depends on only the crown area-to-diameter allometry exponent: a well-conserved value across tropical forests.},

abstract = {Population genetic studies in tropical plants are often challenging because of limited information on taxonomy, phylogenetic relationships and distribution ranges, scarce genomic information and logistic challenges in sampling. We describe a strategy to develop robust and widely applicable genetic markers based on a modest development of genomic resources in the ancient tropical tree species Symphonia globulifera L.f. (Clusiaceae), a keystone species in African and Neotropical rainforests. We provide the first low-coverage (11X) fragmented draft genome sequenced on an individual from Cameroon, covering 1.027 Gbp or 67.5{\%} of the estimated genome size. Annotation of 565 scaffolds (7.57 Mbp) resulted in the prediction of 1046 putative genes (231 of them containing a complete open reading frame) and 1523 exact simple sequence repeats (SSRs, microsatellites). Aligning a published transcriptome of a French Guiana population against this draft genome produced 923 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms. We also preselected genic SSRs in silico that were conserved and polymorphic across a wide geographical range, thus reducing marker development tests on rare DNA samples. Of 23 SSRs tested, 19 amplified and 18 were successfully genotyped in four S. globulifera populations from South America (Brazil and French Guiana) and Africa (Cameroon and S{\~{a}}o Tom{\'{e}} island, FST = 0.34). Most loci showed only population-specific deviations from Hardy–Weinberg proportions, pointing to local population effects (e.g. null alleles). The described genomic resources are valuable for evolutionary studies in Symphonia and for comparative studies in plants. The methods are especially interesting for widespread tropical or endangered taxa with limited DNA availability.},

Evidence from the field is however scarce and inconsistent. We assessed whether a genetic signal underlying herbivory can be detected in oak woodlands when accounting for variation at smaller (within-tree) and larger (among-stand) scales.  Methods We tested relationships between tree genetic relatedness, leaf chemical defences and insect herbivory for different canopy layers in 240 trees from 15 Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) forest stands. We partitioned sources of variability in herbivory and defences among stands, individuals, and branches.  Key Results Leaf defences, insect herbivory and their relationship differed systematically between the upper and the lower tree canopy. When accounting for this canopy effect, the variation explained by tree genetic relatedness rose from 2.8 to 34.1 {\%} for herbivory and from 7.1 to 13.8 {\%} for leaf defences. The effect was driven by markedly stronger relationships in the upper canopy.  Conclusions Our findings illustrate that considerable effects of the host plant genotype on levels of leaf chemical defences and associated insect herbivory can be detected in natural tree populations when within-individual variation is properly accounted for.},

abstract = {Summary 1 We quantified neighbourhood effects on sapling growth for 60 tree species in the 50-ha plot in Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Additionally, we tested whether target sapling growth responds to taxonomic or functional identity of neighbouring species by comparing four alternate models (that all neighbours have equivalent effects on the target; that conspecific and heterospecific neighbours have distinct effects; that heterospecific neighbours can be divided into confamilials and non-confamilials; and that they can be divided according to their response to light availability). 2 Over half of the species (34 out of 60) analysed were consistent with all neighbours having equivalent effects on the target. This may result from diffuse evolution allowing tolerance of a large number of neighbouring species or could be a statistical artefact of over-clumping species into large neighbour groups (e.g. heterospecific neighbours). 3 Other species supported models that differentiated between conspecific and heterospecific (n = 6) or between confamilial vs. non-confamilial (n = 5) neighbours and, in general, effects of neighbours were stronger if they were more closely related to the target. Where target species differentiated between neighbours from different light guilds (n = 15), effects were stronger if both belonged to the same guild (i.e. both gap requiring or both shade tolerant). 4 Despite the fact that the majority of species did not respond to the identity of neighbours, all differed in their response to the degree of crowding. Our results suggest that the response of target species to crowding, rather than individual species effects on targets, may be subject to selection. 5 Variation among species in response to crowding or to the identity of neighbouring species is likely to contribute to the maintenance of species diversity in tropical forests.},

abstract = {The assimilation of carbon by plant communities (gross primary production [GPP]) is a central concern in plant ecology as well as for our understanding of global climate change. As an alternative to traditional methods involving destructive harvests or time-consuming measurements, we present a simple, general model for GPP as the product of the lifetime carbon gain by a single leaf, the daily leaf production rate, and the length of the favorable period for photosynthesis. To test the model, we estimated leaf lifetime carbon gain for 26 species using the concept of mean labor time for leaves (the part of each day the leaf functions to full capacity), average potential photosynthetic capacity over the leaf lifetime, and functional leaf longevity (leaf longevity discounted for periods within a year wholly unfavorable for photosynthesis). We found that the lifetime carbon gain of leaves was rather constant across species. Moreover, when foliar biomass was regressed against functional leaf longevity, aseasonal and seasonal forests fell on a single line, suggesting that the leaf production rate during favorable periods is not substantially different among forests in the world. The gross production of forest ecosystems then can be predicted to a first approximation simply by the annual duration of the period favorable for photosynthetic activity in any given region.},

abstract = {We investigated microclimatic edge gradients associated with grassy powerlines, paved highways and perennial creeks in wet tropical forest in northeastern Australia during wet and dry seasons. Photosynthetically active radiation, air temperature and vapor pressure deficit, soil temperature, canopy temperature, soil moisture, and air speed in the rain forest understory were measured during traverses perpendicular to the forest edge. Light intensity was elevated near the edges of powerlines, highways, and creeks, but this effect was strongest for creek edges. Air temperature and vapor pressure deficit were elevated near powerline edges in the dry season and highway edges in both wet and dry seasons but were not elevated near creek edges in either season. In contrast, soil moisture was lowered near creek edges but not near either powerline or highway edges. No edge gradients were detected for air speed. Canopy temperature was elevated near highway edges and lowered near powerline edges in the wet season but no edge gradients in canopy temperature were detected near creek edges in either the wet or the dry season. We suggest that these different edge gradients may be largely the result of differences in the fluxes of latent and sensible heat within each type of linear canopy opening, with periodic flood disturbance assisting by maintaining a more open canopy near creek edges. Our data indicate that the nature of the linear canopy opening is at least as important as the width in determining the nature and severity of microclimatic edge effects, analogous to the "matrix effect" of traditional fragmentation studies},

Here we relate biogeographic history to patterns of population differentiation, mutational and demographic processes in the widespread rainforest tree Symphonia globulifera using ribosomal (ITS) and chloroplast DNA sequences and nuclear microsatellite (nSSR) loci. Fossil records document sweepstakes dispersal origins of Neotropical S. globulifera populations from Africa during the Miocene. Despite historical long-distance gene flow, nSSR differentiation across 13 populations from Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador (east and west of Andes) and French Guiana was pronounced (F(ST)= 0.14, R(ST)= 0.39, P {\textless} 0.001) and allele-size mutations contributed significantly (R(ST) {\textgreater} F(ST)) to the divergences between cis- and trans-Andean populations. Both DNA sequence and nSSR data reflect contrasting demographic histories in lower Mesoamerica and Amazonia. Amazon populations show weak phylogeographic structure and deviation from drift-mutation equilibrium indicating recent population expansion. In Mesoamerica, genetic drift was strong and contributed to marked differentiation among populations. The genetic structure of S. globulifera contains fingerprints of drift-dispersal processes and phylogeographic footprints of geological uplifts and sweepstakes dispersal.},

We found that considering the hierarchically nested structure of complexity in temporal patterns (i.e. hierarchical complexity) can well describe the fundamental nature of temporal dynamics by expressing which patterns are observed at each scale. Across all ecological levels, driver–response relationships can be temporally variant and dependent on both short- and long-term past conditions.

Average tree growth (diameter at breast height) increased from 0.81 to 2.1 mm yr−1 along a soil texture gradient from 0 to 67{\%} clay, and increasing metal-oxide content. Soil organic carbon stocks in the top 30 cm ranged from 30 to 118 tons C ha−1, phosphorus content ranged from 7 to 600 mg kg−1 soil, and the relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi ranged from 0 to 50{\%}, all positively correlating with soil clay, and iron and aluminum oxide and hydroxide content. In contrast, already low extractable phosphorus (Bray P) content decreased from 4.4 to {\textless}0.02 mg kg−1 in soil with increasing clay content. A greater prevalence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in more clayey forests that had higher tree growth and mortality, but not biomass, indicates that despite the greater investment in nutrient uptake required, soils with higher clay content may actually serve to sustain high tree growth in tropical forests by avoiding phosphorus losses from the ecosystem. Our study demonstrates how variation in soil properties that retain carbon and nutrients can help to explain variation in tropical forest growth and mortality, but not biomass, by requiring niche specialization and contributing to biogeochemical diversification across this region.},

They are extensions of the Simpson index of species diversity. The one function, alpha (r), is defined as the probability that a randomly selected pair of individuals within distance r belong to different species. The other function, beta (r), is the conditional probability that the two individuals belong to different species given that their distance is r. The functions were applied to examining the effects of thinning favoring desirable species in mixed hardwood forest on multispecies spatial patterns and biodiversity. Low alpha (r) and beta (r) for small r and high beta (r) for intermediate r in the thinned plots mean that the thinning involved forming single-species dominant patches. In contrast, almost constant alpha (r) and alpha (r) show that every species is uniformly distributed over the unthinned plots. However, if the largest 50{\%} trees in DBH were selected, the thinned plots have higher diversity at the almost all distances and higher overall diversity. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Forests worldwide are threatened by various environmental and anthropogenic hazards, especially tropical forests. Knowledge on the impacts of these hazards on forest structure and dynamics has been compiled in empirical studies. However, the results of these studies are often not sufficient for long-term projections and extrapolations to large spatial scales especially for unprecedented environmental conditions, which require both the identification and understanding of key underlying processes. Forest models bridge this gap by incorporating multiple ecological processes in a dynamic framework (i.e. including a realistic model structure) and addressing the complexity of forest ecosystems. Here, we describe the evolution of the individual-based and process-based forest gap model FORMIND and its application to tropical forests. At its core, the model includes physiological processes on tree level (photosynthesis, respiration, tree growth, mortality, regeneration, competition). During the past two decades, FORMIND has been used to address various scientific questions arising from different forest types by continuously extending the model structure. The model applications thus provided understanding in three main aspects: (1) the grouping of single tree species into plant functional types is a successful approach to reduce complexity in vegetation models, (2) structural realism was necessary to analyze impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances such as logging, fragmentation, or drought, and (3) complex ecological processes such as carbon fluxes in tropical forests - starting from the individual tree level up to the entire forest ecosystem - can be explored as a function of forest structure, species composition and disturbance regime. Overall, this review shows how the evolution of long-term modelling projects not only provides scientific understanding of forest ecosystems, but also provides benefits for ecological theory and empirical study design.},

abstract = {Inferring population genetic structure from large-scale genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms or variants is an important technique for studying the history and distribution of extant human populations, but it is also a very important tool for adjusting tests of association. However, the structures inferred depend on the minor allele frequency of the variants; this is very important when considering the phenotypic association of rare variants. Using the Genetic Analysis Workshop 18 data set for 142 unrelated individuals, which includes genotypes for many rare variants, we study the following hypothesis: the difference in detected structure is the result of a »scale» effect; that is, rare variants are likely to be shared only locally (smaller scale), while common variants can be spread over longer distances. The result is similar to that of using kernel principal component analysis, as the bandwidth of the kernel is changed. We show how different structures become evident as we consider rare or common variants.},

abstract = {Human-driven land-use changes increasingly threaten biodiversity, particularly in tropical forests where both species diversity and human pressures on natural environments are high(1). The rapid conversion of tropical forests for agriculture, timber production and other uses has generated vast, human-dominated landscapes with potentially dire consequences for tropical biodiversity(2-5). Today, few truly undisturbed tropical forests exist, whereas those degraded by repeated logging and fires, as well as secondary and plantation forests, are rapidly expanding(6,7). Here we provide a global assessment of the impact of disturbance and land conversion on biodiversity in tropical forests using a meta-analysis of 138 studies. We analysed 2,220 pairwise comparisons of biodiversity values in primary forests (with little or no human disturbance) and disturbed forests. We found that biodiversity values were substantially lower in degraded forests, but that this varied considerably by geographic region, taxonomic group, ecological metric and disturbance type. Even after partly accounting for confounding colonization and succession effects due to the composition of surrounding habitats, isolation and time since disturbance, we find that most forms of forest degradation have an overwhelmingly detrimental effect on tropical biodiversity. Our results clearly indicate that when it comes to maintaining tropical biodiversity, there is no substitute for primary forests.},

abstract = {Mounting evidence shows that contrasting selection pressures generate variability in dispersal patterns among individuals or populations of the same species, with potential impacts on both species dynamics and evolution. However, this variability is hardly considered in empirical works, where a single dispersal function is considered to adequately reflect the species-specific dispersal ability, suggesting thereby that within-species variation is negligible as regard to inter-specific differences in dispersal abilities. We propose here an original method to make the comparison of intra- and inter-specific variability in dispersal, by decomposing the diversity of that trait along a phylogeny of closely related species. We used as test group European butterflies that are classic study organisms in spatial ecology. We apply the analysis separately to eight metrics that reflect the dispersal propensity, the dispersal ability or the dispersal efficiency of populations and species. At the inter-specific level, only the dispersal ability showed the signature of a phylogenetic signal while neither the dispersal propensity nor the dispersal efficiency did. At the within-species level, the partitioning of dispersal diversity showed that dispersal was variable or highly variable among populations: intra-specific variability represented from 11{\%} to 133{\%} of inter-specific variability in dispersal metrics. This finding shows that dispersal variation is far from negligible in the wild. Understanding the processes behind this high within-species variation should allow us to properly account for dispersal in demographic models. Accordingly, to encompass the within species variability in life histories the use of more than one value per trait per species should be encouraged in the construction of databases aiming at being sources for modelling purposes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Stevens et al.},

abstract = {1.Plant phenotypic diversity is shaped by the interplay of trade-offs and constraints in evolution. Closely integrated groups of traits (i.e. trait dimensions) are used to classify plant phenotypic diversity into plant strategies, but we do not know the degree of interdependence among trait dimensions. To assess how selection has shaped the phenotypic space, we examine whether trait dimensions are independent.2.We gathered data on saplings of 24 locally coexisting tree species in a temperate forest, and examined the correlation structure of 20 leaf, branch, stem and root traits. These traits fall into three well-established trait dimensions (the leaf economic spectrum, the wood spectrum, and Corner's Rules) that characterize vital plant functions: resource acquisition, sap transport, mechanical support and canopy architecture. Using ordinations, network analyses and Mantel tests, we tested whether the sapling phenotype of these tree species is organized along independent trait dimensions.3.Across species, the sapling phenotype is not structured into clear trait dimensions. The trait relationships defining the trait dimensions are weak and do not dominate the correlation structure of the sapling phenotype as a whole. Instead traits from the three commonly recognized trait dimensions are organized into an integrated trait network. The effect of phylogeny on trait correlations is minimal.4.Our results indicate that trait dimensions apparent in broad-based interspecific surveys do not hold up among locally coexisting species. Furthermore, architectural traits appear central to the phenotypic network, suggesting a pivotal role for branching architecture in linking resource acquisition, mechanical support and hydraulic functions.5.Synthesis. Our study indicates that local and global patterns of phenotypic integration differ and calls into question the use of trait dimensions at local scales. We propose that a network approach to assessing plant function more effectively reflects the multiple trade-offs and constraints shaping the phenotype in locally co-occurring species.This article is protected by copyright.

@article{LIMPERT2001,
abstract = {  As the need grows for conceptualization, formalization, and abstraction in biology, so too does mathematics' relevance to the field (Fagerstr{\"{o}}m et al. 1996). Mathematics is particularly important for analyzing and characterizing random variation of, for example, size and weight of individuals in populations, their sensitivity to chemicals, and time-to-event cases, such as the amount of time an individual needs to recover from illness. The frequency distribution of such data is a major factor determining the type of statistical analysis that can be validly carried out on any data set. Many widely used statistical methods, such as ANOVA (analysis of variance) and regression analysis, require that the data be normally distributed, but only rarely is the frequency distribution of data tested when these techniques are used.  The Gaussian (normal) distribution is most often assumed to describe the random variation that occurs in the data from many scientific disciplines; the well-known bell-shaped curve can easily be characterized and described by two values: the arithmetic mean {\textless}private-char description='[xmacr]' name='xmacr' value='xmacr'/{\textgreater} and the standard deviation s, so that data sets are commonly described by the expression {\textless}private-char description='[xmacr]' name='xmacr' value='xmacr'/{\textgreater} ± s. A historical example of a normal distribution is that of chest measurements of Scottish soldiers made by Quetelet, Belgian founder of modern social statistics (Swoboda 1974). In addition, such disparate phenomena as milk production by cows and random deviations from target values in industrial processes fit a normal distribution.  However, many measurements show a more or less skewed distribution. Skewed distributions are particularly common when mean values are low, variances large, and values cannot be negative, as is the case, for example, with species abundance, lengths of latent periods of infectious diseases, and distribution of mineral resources in the Earth's crust. Such skewed distributions often closely fit the log-normal distribution (Aitchison and Brown 1957, Crow and Shimizu 1988, Lee 1992, Johnson et al. 1994, Sachs 1997). Examples fitting the normal distribution, which is symmetrical, and the log-normal distribution, which is skewed, are given in Figure 1. Note that body height fits both distributions.  Often, biological mechanisms induce log-normal distributions (Koch 1966), as when, for instance, exponential growth is combined with further symmetrical variation: With a mean concentration of, say, 106 bacteria, one cell division more—or less—will lead to 2 × 106—or 5 — 105—cells. Thus, the range will be asymmetrical—to be precise, multiplied or divided by 2 around the mean. The skewed size distribution may be why “exceptionally” big fruit are reported in journals year after year in autumn. Such exceptions, however, may well be the rule: Inheritance of fruit and flower size has long been known to fit the log-normal distribution (Groth 1914, Powers 1936, Sinnot 1937).  What is the difference between normal and log-normal variability? Both forms of variability are based on a variety of forces acting independently of one another. A major difference, however, is that the effects can be additive or multiplicative, thus leading to normal or log-normal distributions, respectively.  Some basic principles of additive and multiplicative effects can easily be demonstrated with the help of two ordinary dice with sides numbered from 1 to 6. Adding the two numbers, which is the principle of most games, leads to values from 2 to 12, with a mean of 7, and a symmetrical frequency distribution. The total range can be described as 7 plus or minus 5 (that is, 7 ± 5) where, in this case, 5 is not the standard deviation. Multiplying the two numbers, however, leads to values between 1 and 36 with a highly skewed distribution. The total variability can be described as 6 multiplied or divided by 6 (or 6 ×/ 6). In this case, the symmetry has moved to the multiplicative level.  Although these examples are neither normal nor log-normal distributions, they do clearly indicate that additive and multiplicative effects give rise to different distributions. Thus, we cannot describe both types of distribution in the same way. Unfortunately, however, common belief has it that quantitative variability is generally bell shaped and symmetrical. The current practice in science is to use symmetrical bars in graphs to indicate standard deviations or errors, and the sign ± to summarize data, even though the data or the underlying principles may suggest skewed distributions (Factor et al. 2000, Keesing 2000, Le Naour et al. 2000, Rhew et al. 2000). In a number of cases the variability is clearly asymmetrical because subtracting three standard deviations from the mean produces negative values, as in the example 100 ± 50. Moreover, the example of the dice shows that the established way to characterize symmetrical, additive variability with the sign ± (plus or minus) has its equivalent in the handy sign ×/ (times or divided by), which will be discussed further below.  Log-normal distributions are usually characterized in terms of the log-transformed variable, using as parameters the expected value, or mean, of its distribution, and the standard deviation. This characterization can be advantageous as, by definition, log-normal distributions are symmetrical again at the log level.  Unfortunately, the widespread aversion to statistics becomes even more pronounced as soon as logarithms are involved. This may be the major reason that log-normal distributions are so little understood in general, which leads to frequent misunderstandings and errors. Plotting the data can help, but graphs are difficult to communicate orally. In short, current ways of handling log-normal distributions are often unwieldy.  To get an idea of a sample, most people prefer to think in terms of the original rather than the log-transformed data. This conception is indeed feasible and advisable for log-normal data, too, because the familiar properties of the normal distribution have their analogies in the log-normal distribution. To improve comprehension of log-normal distributions, to encourage their proper use, and to show their importance in life, we present a novel physical model for generating log-normal distributions, thus filling a 100-year-old gap. We also demonstrate the evolution and use of parameters allowing characterization of the data at the original scale. Moreover, we compare log-normal distributions from a variety of branches of science to elucidate patterns of variability, thereby reemphasizing the importance of log-normal distributions in life.   A physical model demonstrating the genesis of log-normal distributions Section:    Next section  There was reason for Galton (1889) to complain about colleagues who were interested only in averages and ignored random variability. In his thinking, variability was even part of the “charms of statistics.” Consequently, he presented a simple physical model to give a clear visualization of binomial and, finally, normal variability and its derivation.  Figure 2a shows a further development of this “Galton board,” in which particles fall down a board and are deviated at decision points (the tips of the triangular obstacles) either left or right with equal probability. (Galton used simple nails instead of the isosceles triangles shown here, so his invention resembles a pinball machine or the Japanese game Pachinko.) The normal distribution created by the board reflects the cumulative additive effects of the sequence of decision points.  A particle leaving the funnel at the top meets the tip of the first obstacle and is deviated to the left or right by a distance c with equal probability. It then meets the corresponding triangle in the second row, and is again deviated in the same manner, and so forth. The deviation of the particle from one row to the next is a realization of a random variable with possible values +c and −c, and with equal probability for both of them. Finally, after passing r rows of triangles, the particle falls into one of the r + 1 receptacles at the bottom. The probabilities of ending up in these receptacles, numbered 0, 1,{\ldots},r, follow a binomial law with parameters r and p = 0.5. When many particles have made their way through the obstacles, the height of the particles piled up in the several receptacles will be approximately proportional to the binomial probabilities.  For a large number of rows, the probabilities approach a normal density function according to the central limit theorem. In its simplest form, this mathematical law states that the sum of many (r) independent, identically distributed random variables is, in the limit as r→∞, normally distributed. Therefore, a Galton board with many rows of obstacles shows normal density as the expected height of particle piles in the receptacles, and its mechanism captures the idea of a sum of r independent random variables.  Figure 2b shows how Galton's construction was modified to describe the distribution of a product of such variables, which ultimately leads to a log-normal distribution. To this aim, scalene triangles are needed (although they appear to be isosceles in the figure), with the longer side to the right. Let the distance from the left edge of the board to the tip of the first obstacle below the funnel be xm. The lower corners of the first triangle are at xm {\textperiodcentered} c and xm/c (ignoring the gap necessary to allow the particles to pass between the obstacles). Therefore, the particle meets the tip of a triangle in the next row at X = xm {\textperiodcentered} c, or X = xm /c, with equal probabilities for both values. In the second and following rows, the triangles with the tip at distance x from the left edge have lower corners at x {\textperiodcentered} c and x/c (up to the gap width). Thus, the horizontal position of a particle is multiplied in each row by a random variable with equal probab},

abstract = {Analyzing vertebrate genomes requires rapid mRNA/DNA and cross-species protein alignments. A new tool, BLAT, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for mRNA/DNA alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. BLAT's speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping K-mers in the genome. This index fits inside the RAM of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. BLAT has several major stages. It uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. It performs an alignment between homologous regions. It stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). Finally, BLAT revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible. This paper describes how BLAT was optimized. Effects on speed and sensitivity are explored for various K-mer sizes, mismatch schemes, and number of required index matches. BLAT is compared with other alignment programs on various test sets and then used in several genome-wide applications. http://genome.ucsc.edu hosts a web-based BLAT server for the human genome.},

abstract = {* 1Statistical modelling is often used to relate sparse biological survey data to remotely derived environmental predictors, thereby providing a basis for predictively mapping biodiversity across an entire region of interest. The most popular strategy for such modelling has been to model distributions of individual species one at a time. Spatial modelling of biodiversity at the community level may, however, confer significant benefits for applications involving very large numbers of species, particularly if many of these species are recorded infrequently.
* 2Community-level modelling combines data from multiple species and produces information on spatial pattern in the distribution of biodiversity at a collective community level instead of, or in addition to, the level of individual species. Spatial outputs from community-level modelling include predictive mapping of community types (groups of locations with similar species composition), species groups (groups of species with similar distributions), axes or gradients of compositional variation, levels of compositional dissimilarity between pairs of locations, and various macro-ecological properties (e.g. species richness).
* 3Three broad modelling strategies can be used to generate these outputs: (i) ‘assemble first, predict later', in which biological survey data are first classified, ordinated or aggregated to produce community-level entities or attributes that are then modelled in relation to environmental predictors; (ii) ‘predict first, assemble later', in which individual species are modelled one at a time as a function of environmental variables, to produce a stack of species distribution maps that is then subjected to classification, ordination or aggregation; and (iii) ‘assemble and predict together', in which all species are modelled simultaneously, within a single integrated modelling process. These strategies each have particular strengths and weaknesses, depending on the intended purpose of modelling and the type, quality and quantity of data involved.
* 4Synthesis and applications. The potential benefits of modelling large multispecies data sets using community-level, as opposed to species-level, approaches include faster processing, increased power to detect shared patterns of environmental response across rarely recorded species, and enhanced capacity to synthesize complex data into a form more readily interpretable by scientists and decision-makers. Community-level modelling therefore deserves to be considered more often, and more widely, as a potential alternative or supplement to modelling individual species.},

abstract = {Abstract Identifying processes underlying the genetic and morphological differences among populations is a central question of evolutionary biology. Forest trees typically contain high levels of neutral genetic variation, and genetic differences are often correlated with geographic distance between populations [isolation by distance (IBD)] or are due to historic vicariance events [isolation by colonization (IBC)]. In contrast, morphological differences are largely due to local adaptation. Here, we examined genetic (microsatellite) and morphological (from a common garden experiment) variation in Populus nigra L., European black poplar, collected from 13 sites across western Europe and grown in a common garden in Belgium. Significant genetic differentiation was observed, with populations from France displaying greater admixture than the distinct Spanish and central European gene pools, consistent with previously described glacial refugia (IBC). Many quantitative traits displayed a bimodal distribution, approximately corresponding to small-leaf and large-leaf ecotypes. Examination of nine climatic variables revealed the sampling locations to have diverse climates, and although the correlation between morphological and climatic differences was significant, the pattern was not consistent with strict local adaptation. Partial Mantel tests based on multivariate summary statistics identified significant residual correlation in comparisons of small-leaf to large-leaf ecotypes, and within the small-leaf samples, but not within large-leaf ecotypes, indicating that variation within the small-leaf morphotype in particular may be adaptive. Some small-leaf populations experience climates very similar to those in large-leaf sites. We conclude that adaptive differentiation and persistent IBC acted in combination to produce the genetic and morphological patterns observed in P. nigra.},

In sunflowers, species found in the most extreme habitats are ancient hybrids, and new gene combinations generated by hybridization are speculated to have contributed to ecological divergence. This possibility was tested through phenotypic and genomic comparisons of ancient and synthetic hybrids. Most trait differences in ancient hybrids could be recreated by complementary gene action in synthetic hybrids and were favored by selection. The same combinations of parental chromosomal segments required to generate extreme phenotypes in synthetic hybrids also occurred in ancient hybrids. Thus, hybridization facilitated ecological divergence in sunflowers.},

abstract = {To explain diversity in forests, niche theory must show how multiple plant species coexist while competing for the same resources. Although successional processes are widespread in forests, theoretical work has suggested that differentiation in successional strategy allows only a few species stably to coexist, including only a single shade tolerant. However, this conclusion is based on current niche models, which encode a very simplified view of plant communities, suggesting that the potential for niche differentiation has remained unexplored. Here, we show how extending successional niche models to include features common to all vegetation-height-structured competition for light under a prevailing disturbance regime and two trait-mediated tradeoffs in plant function-enhances the diversity of species that can be maintained, including a diversity of shade tolerants. We identify two distinct axes of potential niche differentiation, corresponding to the traits leaf mass per unit leaf area and height at maturation. The first axis allows for coexistence of different shade tolerances and the second axis for coexistence among species with the same shade tolerance. Addition of this second axis leads to communities with a high diversity of shade tolerants. Niche differentiation along the second axis also generates regions of trait space wherein fitness is almost equalized, an outcome we term "evolutionarily emergent near-neutrality." For different environmental conditions, our model predicts diverse vegetation types and trait mixtures, akin to observations. These results indicate that the outcomes of successional niche differentiation are richer than previously thought and potentially account for mixtures of traits and species observed in forests worldwide.},

Here we compare fits of the dispersal and density-dependence mechanisms for empirical RSA data on tree species in six New and Old World tropical forests and show that both mechanisms offer sufficient and independent explanations. We suggest that RSA data cannot by themselves be used to discriminate among these explanations of RSA patterns15 - empirical studies will be required to determine whether RSA patterns are due to one or the other mechanism, or to some combination of both. {\textcopyright} 2005 Nature Publishing Group.},

As opposed to the standard method of estimating a single FST value, this approach takes into account the fact that in most if not all realistic situations, local populations differ in their effective sizes and migration rates. Therefore, the use of this approach can help better describe the genetic structure of populations. Despite this obvious advantage, this method has remained largely underutilized by molecular ecologists. Thus, the objective of this review is to foster its use for studying the genetic structure of metapopulations. We present the derivation of the Bayesian formulation for the estimation of population-specific FST's based on the multinomial-Dirichlet distribution. We describe several recent applications of the F-model and present the results of a small simulation study that explains how the F-model can help better describe the genetic structure of populations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Timber production is an important economic sector in most forested countries of Central Africa, where about 14 million hectares of lowland moist forests are now planned for management. This production is expected to be sustainable, but the actual impact of logging on biodiversity is still questioned.To answer this question, we used a unique long-term controlled experiment implemented more than 20. years ago in an old-growth semi-deciduous moist forest of the Central African Republic (CAR). We tested whether (i) anthropogenic disturbances associated with silvicultural operations had an effect on the composition and diversity of tree communities, and (ii) there is a relationship between diversity and disturbance intensity in those forests.For this, we botanically identified all trees. ≥. 10. cm DBH in 28 1-ha plots where no treatment (controls), logging and logging. +. thinning operations were implemented 24. years ago and created a strong gradient of disturbance. We investigated the relationships between five diversity indices and a disturbance index calculated for each 1-ha plot, for all species and separately for three regeneration guilds.We found a strong positive monotonic relationship between the intensity of disturbance and the percentage of pioneer species in the tree communities, which proved to be equally detrimental, in terms of relative abundance, to the non-pioneer light-demanding and the shade-bearing species.Overall, disturbance appeared to have a weak monotonous negative effect on diversity, irrespective to the index considered. The diversity of shade-bearers slightly decreased along the disturbance gradient without significant decrease in species density; disturbance had no effect on non-pioneer light demanders, but a clear significant negative effect on the diversity of pioneers, with a significant decrease in species density. This negative effect was associated with the massive recruitment of the early-successional, fast-growing Musanga cecropioides R. Br. (Urticaceae), which rapidly preempted space and resources in the most disturbed plots. Despite this effect, disturbance did not significantly affect the local heterogeneity in species distribution.These results suggest that the semi-deciduous moist forests of CAR are locally resilient to small-scale disturbances associated with silvicultural operations. This may be a consequence of the past anthropogenic and/or climatic disturbances, which have been stronger and more long-lasting than elsewhere within the tropical forest biome, and would have removed the most vulnerable species. Because logging intensity in these forests is usually low, we do not expect any direct major impact on tree species diversity, at least after the first felling cycle. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The maintenance in the long run of a positive carbon balance under very low irradiance is a prerequisite for survival of tree seedlings below the canopy or in small gaps in a tropical rainforest. To provide a quantitative basis for this assumption, experiments were carried out to determine whether construction cost (CC) and payback time for leaves and support structures, as well as leaf life span (i) differ among species and (ii) display an irradiance-elicited plasticity. Experiments were also conducted to determine whether leaf life span correlates to CC and payback time and is close to the optimal longevity derived from an optimization model. Saplings from 13 tropical tree species were grown under three levels of irradiance. Specific-CC was computed, as well as CC scaled to leaf area at the metamer level. Photosynthesis was recorded over the leaf life span. Payback time was derived from CC and a simple photosynthesis model. Specific-CC displayed only little interspecific variability and irradiance-elicited plasticity, in contrast to CC scaled to leaf area. Leaf life span ranged from 4 months to {\textgreater}26 months among species, and was longest in seedlings grown under lowest irradiance. It was always much longer than payback time, even under the lowest irradiance. Leaves were shed when their photosynthesis had reached very low values, in contrast to what was predicted by an optimality model. The species ranking for the different traits was stable across irradiance treatments. The two pioneer species always displayed the smallest CC, leaf life span, and payback time. All species displayed a similar large irradiance-elicited plasticity.},

It is already being extensively applied to describe how ecosystem biomass and structure vary between sites, but can also facilitate major advances in developing and testing mechanistic theories of tree form and forest structure, thereby enabling us to understand why trees and forests have the biomass and three-dimensional structure they do. Here we focus on the ecological challenges and benefits of understanding tree form, and highlight some advances related to capturing and describing tree shape that are becoming possible with the advent of TLS. We present examples of ongoing work that applies, or could potentially apply, new TLS measurements to better understand the constraints on optimization of tree form. Theories of resource distribution networks, such as metabolic scaling theory, can be tested and further refined. TLS can also provide new approaches to the scaling of woody surface area and crown area, and thereby better quantify the metabolism of trees. Finally, we demonstrate how we can develop a more mechanistic understanding of the effects of avoidance of wind risk on tree form and maximum size. Over the next few years, TLS promises to deliver both major empirical and conceptual advances in the quantitative understanding of trees and tree-dominated ecosystems, leading to advances in understanding the ecology of why trees and ecosystems look and grow the way they do.},

abstract = {Ecological resilience, adaptive cycles, and panarchy are all concepts that have been developed to explain abrupt and often surprising changes in complex socio-ecological systems that are prone to disturbances. These types of changes involve qualitative and quantitative alterations in systems' structures and processes. This paper uses the concepts of ecological resilience, adaptive cycles, and panarchies to compare ecological and human community systems. At least five important findings emerge from this comparison. 1) Both systems demonstrate the multiple meanings of resilience-both in terms of recovery time from disturbances and the capacity to absorb them. 2) Both systems recognize the role of diversity in contributing to resilience. 3) The comparison highlights the role of different forms of capital and 4) the importance of cross-scale interactions. 5) The comparison reveals the need for experimentation and learning to build adaptive capacities. All of these ideas have broad implications for attempting to manage complex systems with human and ecological components in the face of recurring natural disasters. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the author(s).},

abstract = {Drought-induced tree mortality has been observed globally and is expected to increase under climate change scenarios, with large potential consequences for the terrestrial carbon sink. Predicting mortality across species is crucial for assessing the effects of climate extremes on forest community biodiversity, composition, and carbon sequestration. However, the physiological traits associated with elevated risk of mortality in diverse ecosystems remain unknown, although these traits could greatly improve understanding and prediction of tree mortality in forests. We performed a meta-analysis on species' mortality rates across 475 species from 33 studies around the globe to assess which traits determine a species' mortality risk. We found that species-specific mortality anomalies from community mortality rate in a given drought were associated with plant hydraulic traits. Across all species, mortality was best predicted by a low hydraulic safety margin-the difference between typical minimum xylem water potential and that causing xylem dysfunction-and xylem vulnerability to embolism. Angiosperms and gymnosperms experienced roughly equal mortality risks. Our results provide broad support for the hypothesis that hydraulic traits capture key mechanisms determining tree death and highlight that physiological traits can improve vegetation model prediction of tree mortality during climate extremes.},

abstract = {Conservationists are far from able to assist all species under threat, if only for lack of funding. This places a premium on priorities: how can we support the most species at the least cost? One way is to identify 'biodiversity hotspots' where exceptional concentrations of endemic species are undergoing exceptional loss of habitat. As many as 44{\%} of all species of vascular plants and 35{\%} of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4{\%} of the land surface of the Earth. This opens the way for a 'silver bullet' strategy on the part of conservation planners, focusing on these hotspots in proportion to their share of the world's species at risk.},

abstract = {An open question in human evolution is the importance of polygenic adaptation: adaptive changes in the mean of a multifactorial trait due to shifts in allele frequencies across many loci. In recent years, several methods have been developed to detect polygenic adaptation using loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Though powerful, these methods suffer from limited interpretability: they can detect which sets of populations have evidence for polygenic adaptation, but are unable to reveal where in the history of multiple populations these processes occurred. To address this, we created a method to detect polygenic adaptation in an admixture graph, which is a representation of the historical divergences and admixture events relating different populations through time. We developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to infer branch-specific parameters reflecting the strength of selection in each branch of a graph. Additionally, we developed a set of summary statistics that are fast to compute and can indicate which branches are most likely to have experienced polygenic adaptation. We show via simulations that this method—which we call PolyGraph—has good power to detect polygenic adaptation, and applied it to human population genomic data from around the world. We also provide evidence that variants associated with several traits, including height, educational attainment, and self-reported unibrow, have been influenced by polygenic adaptation in different populations during human evolution.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Investigating the causes and consequences of intraspecific trait variation (ITV) in plants is not novel, as it has long been recognized that such variation shapes biotic and abiotic interactions. While evolutionary and population biology have extensively investigated ITV, only in the last 10 years has interest in ITV surged within community and comparative ecology. SCOPE: Despite this recent interest, still lacking are thorough descriptions of ITV's extent, the spatial and temporal structure of ITV, and stronger connections between ITV and community and ecosystem properties. Our primary aim in this review is to synthesize the recent literature and ask: (1) How extensive is intraspecific variation in traits across scales, and what underlying mechanisms drive this variation? (2) How does this variation impact higher-order ecological processes (e.g. population dynamics, community assembly, invasion, ecosystem productivity)? (3) What are the consequences of ignoring ITV and how can these be mitigated? and (4) What are the most pressing research questions, and how can current practices be modified to suit our research needs? Our secondary aim is to target diverse and underrepresented traits and plant organs, including anatomy, wood, roots, hydraulics, reproduction and secondary chemistry. In addressing these aims, we showcase papers from the Special Issue. CONCLUSIONS: Plant ITV plays a key role in determining individual and population performance, species interactions, community structure and assembly, and ecosystem properties. Its extent varies widely across species, traits and environments, and it remains difficult to develop a predictive model for ITV that is broadly applicable. Systematically characterizing the sources (e.g. ontogeny, population differences) of ITV will be a vital step forward towards identifying generalities and the underlying mechanisms that shape ITV. While the use of species means to link traits to higher-order processes may be appropriate in many cases, such approaches can obscure potentially meaningful variation. We urge the reporting of individual replicates and population means in online data repositories, a greater consideration of the mechanisms that enhance and constrain ITV's extent, and studies that span sub-disciplines.},

@article{Russo2008,
abstract = {1. Interspecific relationships between fundamental demographic rates, often called demographic trade-offs, emerge from constraints within individuals related to morphology, physiology and resource allocation. Plant species that grow fast in high light usually have high mortality in shade, and this well-established relationship in part defines a species' successional niche. More generally, this relationship represents a trade-off between a species' ability to grow quickly to exploit abundant resources vs. avoiding mortality when resources are less plentiful, but few studies have described this demographic trade-off with respect to environmental factors other than light. 2. Using demographic data from 960 tree species in Bornean rain forest, we examined the evidence for an interspecific demographic trade-off between fast growth and low mortality and its variation among habitats defined by variation in soil fertility and moisture. Such a trade-off could contribute to sorting of tree species among habitats and partly explain the striking patterns of species' edaphic associations in this and other forests. 3. We found strong evidence for this demographic trade-off, both within the same habitat and when growth on edaphically rich habitats was compared with mortality on a habitat with lower below-ground resource availability. 4. The slope of the growth-mortality relationship varied among habitats, being steepest on the habitat lowest in below-ground resources. For species with the fastest potential growth rates, mortality was higher on this habitat than at comparable growth rates on the three more edaphically rich habitats, providing a possible mechanism by which fast-growing species may be eliminated from the poorest habitat. Adaptations for fast growth may entail a greater mortality risk, if inherently fast-growing species fail to maintain a positive C-balance when below-ground resources are scarce. 5. Conversely, for species with the slowest potential growth rates, the highest species' mortality rates occurred on the habitats with greatest below-ground resource availability, implying that slow-growing species may have a competitive disadvantage in resource-rich environments. 6. Synthesis. Differences among habitats in the steepness of this trade-off may sort species into different habitats along this edaphic gradient, whereas on the same soil, this demographic trade-off could facilitate coexistence of at least some species in this forest. Thus, by generating emergent demographic trade-offs that vary along resource gradients, plant life-history strategies can influence species diversity and distribution. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

abstract = {In this study we explore morphological and ecological variation in sympatric populations of Pagamea coriacea s.l. - a species complex from white-sand vegetation in the Amazon. A total of 147 trees were sampled and monitored at three nearby sites in Central Amazon, Brazil. Multivariate analyses of morphology indicated two distinct groups (A and B), which also differed in bark type, each containing subgroups associated with sexual dimorphism. However, a single hermaphroditic individual was observed within group B. As expected, all pistillate plants produced fruits, but 23{\%} of the staminate plants of group B, and 5{\%} of group A also produced fruits. This variation suggests that the sexual systems of both groups are between dioecy and gynodioecy. There was an overlap in flowering phases between the two groups, but the pattern of floral maturation differed. Ecologically, plants of group B were found in more shaded habitats and over sandstone bedrocks, while group A was prevalent in deeper sandy soils as canopy plants. The significances of morphological and environmental differences were tested by a multivariate analysis of variance, and a canonical discriminant analysis assessed the importance of variables. The coexistence in sympatry of two discrete morphological groups in the P. coriacea s.l., with different habitat preferences and reproductive behaviors, indicates they represent distinct species.O objetivo deste estudo foi testar se o complexo de esp{\'{e}}cies Pagamea coriacea inclui m{\'{u}}ltiplas esp{\'{e}}cies, usando evid{\^{e}}ncias morfol{\'{o}}gicas, ecol{\'{o}}gicas e de comportamento reprodutivo.

abstract = {We present a likelihood-based regression method that was developed to analyze the effects of neighborhood competitive interactions and hurricane damage on tree growth and survival. The purpose of the method is to provide robust parameter estimates for a spatially explicit forest simulator and to gain insight into the processes that drive the patterns of species abundance in tropical forests. We test the method using census data from the 16-ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot in Puerto Rico and describe effects of the spatial configuration, sizes, and species of neighboring trees on the growth and survival of 12 dominant tree species representing a variety of life history strategies. Variation in sizedependent growth and mortality suggests a complex relationship between size, growth, and survival under different regimes of light availability. Crowding effects on growth and survival appear to be idiosyncratic to each individual species, and with the exception of pioneers, there is little commonality among species that share similar life histories. We also explain the implications of differential susceptibility to hurricane damage on species' growth and survival and on their ability to respond to damage to neighboring trees. Tree species in the Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot differ strikingly in both their susceptibility to hurricane disturbance and the nature of their recovery from wind disturbance, through response of both adult plants and juveniles to enhanced resource availability. At the stand level, intense competitive thinning of densely packed saplings that grew after hurricane damage accounted for the majority of post-hurricane mortality, particularly for shadeintolerant species. At the individual species level, effects of previous hurricane damage on growth and survival depended primarily on variation in the quantity and quality of hurricane damage sustained by target species and their interaction with life history characteristics of these individual species. Finally, we compare models that make different assumptions about the effects of competing species on tree growth and survival (e.g., equivalence of competitors vs. distinct species-specific effects). Size effects alone could not account for growth and survival for the majority of target species. Our results also demonstrate that competing species have distinct per capita effects on growth of dominant target species. In contrast, we found moderate support for a model that assumed functional equivalence of competitors on survival.},

Yet, in species such as trees, evidence of microgeographic adaptation and the quantitative assessment of the impact of gene flow on adaptive genetic variation are still limited. Here, we used extensive genetic and phenotypic data from European beech seedlings collected along an elevation gradient, and grown in a common garden, to study the signature of selection on the divergence of eleven potentially adaptive traits, and to assess the role of gene flow in resupplying adaptive genetic variation. We found a significant signal of adaptive differentiation among plots separated by {\textless} 1 km, with selection acting on growth and phenological traits. Consistent with theoretical expectations, our results suggest that pollen dispersal contributes to increase genetic diversity for these locally differentiated traits. Our results thus highlight that local selection is an important evolutionary force in natural tree populations and suggest that management interventions to facilitate movement of gametes along short ecological gradients would boost genetic diversity of individual tree populations, and enhance their adaptive potential to rapidly changing environments.},

Here I use models of competition among genotypes and species to demonstrate a strong positive effect of the number of genotypes per species on species diversity across a range of conditions. Genetic diversity allows species to respond to selection imposed by competition, resulting in both functional convergence and divergence among species depending on their initial niche positions. This ability to respond to selection promotes species coexistence and contributes to a reduction in variation in species composition among communities. These models suggest that whenever individual fitness depends on the degree of functional similarity between a focal individual and its competitors, genetic diversity should promote species coexistence; this prediction is consistent with the few relevant empirical data collected to date. The results point to the importance of considering the genetic origin and diversity of material used in ecological experiments and in restoration efforts, in addition to highlighting potentially important community consequences of the loss of genetic diversity in natural populations.},

Joint models can be used for several purposes of interest to ecologists, including estimating patterns of residual correlation across taxa, ordination, multivariate inference about environmental effects and environment-by-trait interactions, accounting for missing predictors, and improving predictions in situations where one can leverage knowledge of some species to predict others. We demonstrate this by example and discuss recent computation tools and future directions. Many ecological questions require the joint analysis of abundances collected simultaneously across many taxonomic groups, and, if organisms are identified using modern tools such as metabarcoding, their number can be in the thousands.While historically such data have been analyzed using ad hoc algorithms, it is now possible to fully specify joint statistical models for abundance using multivariate extensions of generalized linear mixed models.These modern 'joint modeling' approaches allow the study of correlation patterns across taxa, at the same time as studying environmental response, to tease the two apart.Latent variable models are an especially exciting tool that has recently been used for ordination as well as for studying the factors driving co-occurrence.},

abstract = {Theory relating species richness to ecosystem variability typically ignores the potential for environmental variability to promote species coexistence. Failure to account for fluctuation-dependent coexistence mechanisms may explain observed deviations from the expected negative diversity-variability relationship, and limits our ability to predict the consequences of future increases in environmental variability. We use a consumer-resource model to explore how coexistence via the temporal storage effect and relative nonlinearity affects ecosystem variability. We show that a positive, rather than negative, diversity-variability relationship is possible when ecosystem function is sampled across a natural gradient in environmental variability and diversity. We also show how fluctuation-dependent coexistence can buffer ecosystem functioning against increasing environmental variability by promoting species richness and portfolio effects. Our work provides a general explanation for variation in observed diversity-variability relationships and highlights the importance of conserving regional species pools to help buffer ecosystems against predicted increases in environmental variability.},

abstract = {Negative density-dependent recruitment of seedlings, that is, seeds of a given species are less likely to become established seedlings if the density of that species is high, has been proposed to be an important mechanism contributing to the extraordinary diversity of tropical tree communities because it can potentially prevent any particular species from usurping all available space, either in close proximity to seed sources or at relatively larger spatial scales. However, density-dependent recruitment does not necessarily enhance community diversity. Furthermore, although density-dependent effects have been found at some life stages in some species, no study has shown that density-dependent recruitment affects community diversity. Here we report the results of observations in a lowland, moist forest in the Republic of Panam{\'{a}} in which the species identities of 386,027 seeds that arrived at 200 seed traps were compared with the species identities of 13,068 seedlings that recruited into adjacent plots over a 4-year period. Across the 200 sites, recruit seedling diversity was significantly higher than seed diversity. Part of this difference was explained by interspecies differences in average recruitment success. Even after accounting for these differences, however, negative density-dependent recruitment contributes significantly to the increase in diversity from seeds to seedling recruits.},

abstract = {Climate is a major environmental factor affecting the phenotype of trees and is also a critical agent of natural selection that has molded among-population genetic variation. Population response functions describe the environmental effect of planting site climates on the performance of a single population, whereas transfer functions describe among-population genetic variation molded by natural selection for climate. Although these approaches are widely used to predict the responses of trees to climate change, both have limitations. We present a novel approach that integrates both genetic and environmental effects into a single "universal response function" (URF) to better predict the influence of climate on phenotypes. Using a large lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) field transplant experiment composed of 140 populations planted on 62 sites to demonstrate the methodology, we show that the URF makes full use of data from provenance trials to: (1) improve predictions of climate change impacts on phenotypes; (2) reduce the size and cost of future provenance trials without compromising predictive power; (3) more fully exploit existing, less comprehensive provenance tests; (4) quantify and compare environmental and genetic effects of climate on population performance; and (5) predict the performance of any population growing in any climate. Finally, we discuss how the last attribute allows the URF to be used as a mechanistic model to predict population and species ranges for the future and to guide assisted migration of seed for reforestation, restoration, or afforestation and genetic conservation in a changing climate.},

abstract = {The distribution of plant species, the species compositions of different sites, and the factors that affect them in tropical rain forests are not well understood. The main hypotheses are that species composition is either (i) uniform over large areas, (ii) random but spatially autocorrelated because of dispersal limitation, or (iii) patchy and environmentally determined. Here we test these hypotheses, using a large data set from western Amazonia. The uniformity hypothesis gains no support, but the other hypotheses do. Environmental determinism explains a larger proportion of the variation in floristic differences between sites than does dispersal limitation; together, these processes explain 70 to 75{\%} of the variation. Consequently, it is important that management planning for conservation and resource use take into account both habitat heterogeneity and biogeographic differences.},

abstract = {We dissected the relationship between genetic differentiation (Q(ST)) for a trait and its underlying genes (G(STq), differentiation for a quantitative locus) in an evolutionary context, with the aim of identifying the conditions in which these two measurements are decoupled. We used two parameters ($\theta$(B) and $\theta$(W)) scaling the contributions of inter- and intrapopulation allelic covariation between genes controlling the trait of interest. We monitored the changes in $\theta$(B) and $\theta$(W), Q(ST) and G(STq) over successive generations of divergent and stabilizing selection, in simulations for an outcrossing species with extensive gene flow. The dynamics of these parameters are characterized by two phases. Initially, during the earliest generations, differentiation of the trait increases very rapidly and the principal and immediate driver of Q(ST) is $\theta$(B). During subsequent generations, G(STq) increases steadily and makes an equal contribution to Q(ST). These results show that selection first captures beneficial allelic associations at different loci at different populations, and then targets changes in allelic frequencies. The same patterns are observed when environmental change modifies divergent selection, as shown by the very rapid response of $\theta$(B) to the changes of selection regimes. We compare our results with previous experimental findings and consider their relevance to the detection of molecular signatures of natural selection.},

abstract = {We investigated leaf physiological traits of dominant canopy trees in four lowland Panamanian forests with contrasting mean annual precipitation (1,800, 2,300, 3,100 and 3,500 mm). There was near complete turn-over of dominant canopy tree species among sites, resulting in greater dominance of evergreen species with long-lived leaves as precipitation increased. Mean structural and physiological traits changed along this gradient as predicted by cost-benefit theories of leaf life span. Nitrogen content per unit mass (Nmass) and light- and CO2-saturated photosynthetic rates per unit mass (Pmass) of upper canopy leaves decreased with annual precipitation, and these changes were partially explained by increasing leaf thickness and decreasing specific leaf area (SLA). Comparison of 1,800 mm and 3,100 mm sites, where canopy access was available through the use of construction cranes, revealed an association among extended leaf longevity, greater structural defense, higher midday leaf water potential, and lower Pmass, Nmass, and SLA at wetter sites. Shorter leaf life spans and more enriched foliar delta15N values in drier sites suggest greater resorption and re-metabolism of leaf N in drier forest. Greater dominance of short-lived leaves with relatively high Pmass in drier sites reflects a strategy to maximize photosynthesis when water is available and to minimize water loss and respiration costs during rainless periods. Overall, our study links coordinated change in leaf functional traits that affect productivity and nutrient cycling to seasonality in lowland tropical forests.},

abstract = {Intraspecific trait variation (ITV) is common feature of natural communities and has gained increasing attention due to its significant ecological effects on community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. However, the estimation of ITV per se has yet to receive much attention, despite the need for accurate ITV estimation for trait-based ecological inferences. It remains unclear if, and to what extent, current estimations of ITV are biased. The most common method used to quantify ITV is the coefficient of variation (CV), which is dimensionless and can therefore be compared across traits, species, and studies. Here, we asked which CV estimator and data normalization method are optimal for quantifying ITV, and further identified the minimum sample size required for ±5{\%} accuracy assuming a completely random sample scheme. To these ends, we compared the performance of four existing CV estimators, together with new simple composite estimators, across different data normalizations, and sample sizes using both a simulated and empirical trait datasets from local to regional scales. Our results consistently showed that the most commonly used ITV estimator (CV1= $\sigma$sample/$\mu$sample), often underestimated ITV—in some cases by nearly 50{\%}—and that underestimation varies largely among traits and species. The extent of this bias depends on the sample size, skewness and kurtosis of the trait value distribution. The bias in ITV can be substantially reduced by using log-transforming trait data and alternative CV estimators that take into consideration the above dependencies. We find that the CV4 estimator, also known as Bao's CV estimator, combined with log data normalization, exhibits the lowest bias and can reach ±5{\%} accuracy with sample sizes greater than 20 for almost all examined traits and species. These results demonstrated that many previous ITV measurements may be substantially underestimated and, further, that these underestimations are not equal among species and traits even using the same sample size. These problems can be largely solved by log-transforming trait data first and then using the Bao's CV to quantify ITV. Together, our findings facilitate a more accurate understanding of ITV in community structures and dynamics, and may also benefit studies in other research areas that depend on accurate estimation of CV.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA barcoding of rain forest trees could potentially help biologists identify species and discover new ones. However, DNA barcodes cannot always distinguish between closely related species, and the size and completeness of barcode databases are key parameters for their successful application. We test the ability of rbcL, matK and trnH-psbA plastid DNA markers to identify rain forest trees at two sites in Atlantic central Africa under the assumption that a database is exhaustive in terms of species content, but not necessarily in terms of haplotype diversity within species.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We assess the accuracy of identification to species or genus using a genetic distance matrix between samples either based on a global multiple sequence alignment (GD) or on a basic local alignment search tool (BLAST). Where a local database is available (within a 50 ha plot), barcoding was generally reliable for genus identification (95-100{\%} success), but less for species identification (71-88{\%}). Using a single marker, best results for species identification were obtained with trnH-psbA. There was a significant decrease of barcoding success in species-rich clades. When the local database was used to identify the genus of trees from another region and did include all genera from the query individuals but not all species, genus identification success decreased to 84-90{\%}. The GD method performed best but a global multiple sequence alignment is not applicable on trnH-psbA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Barcoding is a useful tool to assign unidentified African rain forest trees to a genus, but identification to a species is less reliable, especially in species-rich clades, even using an exhaustive local database. Combining two markers improves the accuracy of species identification but it would only marginally improve genus identification. Finally, we highlight some limitations of the BLAST algorithm as currently implemented and suggest possible improvements for barcoding applications.},

abstract = {Recent studies provide compelling evidence for the idea that creative thinking draws upon two kinds of processes linked to distinct physiological features, and stimulated under different conditions. In short, the fast system-I produces intuition whereas the slow and deliberate system-II produces reasoning. System-I can help see novel solutions and associations instantaneously, but is prone to error. System-II has other biases, but can help checking and modifying the system-I results. Although thinking is the core business of science, the accepted ways of doing our work focus almost entirely on facilitating system-II.

abstract = {Community ecology and ecosystem ecology provide two perspectives on complex ecological systems that have largely complementary strengths and weaknesses. Merging the two perspectives is necessary both to ensure continued scientific progress and to provide society with the scientific means to face growing environmental challenges. Recent research on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has contributed to this goal in several ways. By addressing a new question of high relevance for both science and society, by challenging existing paradigms, by tightly linking theory and experiments, by building scientific consensus beyond differences in opinion, by integrating fragmented disciplines and research fields, by connecting itself to other disciplines and management issues, it has helped transform ecology not only in content, but also in form. Creating a genuine evolutionary ecosystem ecology that links the evolution of species traits at the individual level, the dynamics of species interactions, and the overall functioning of ecosystems would give new impetus to this much-needed process of unification across ecological disciplines. Recent community evolution models are a promising step in that direction.},

abstract = {* Forests account for a substantial part of the terrestrial biomass storage and productivity. To better understand forest productivity, we need to disentangle the processes underlying net biomass change. * We tested how above-ground net biomass change and its underlying biomass dynamics (biomass recruitment, growth and mortality) can be explained by four alternative and contested hypotheses; the soil fertility, biomass ratio, niche complementarity and vegetation quantity hypotheses. * Above-ground biomass dynamics were evaluated over a 5-year period in 200 permanent sample plots in 8 tropical dry forests in Brazil, and related to soil fertility, community-weighted mean (CWM) traits that are important for carbon storage and sequestration (wood density, specific leaf area, maximum stem diameter and deciduousness), species richness, functional diversity and initial stand biomass. * Initial stand biomass was the best predictor of all three processes of biomass dynamics, providing strong support for the vegetation quantity hypothesis. In these dry forests, the dominance of conservative species, rather than of acquisitive species, is associated with high biomass growth and storage, probably because their low specific leaf area and high wood density allow them to keep on functioning during drought stress. * Paradoxically, high soil fertility (Ca) led to low biomass productivity, probably because of nutrient imbalance. * In contrast to what is shown for controlled experiments, we found no support for niche complementarity (in terms of functional diversity or species richness) for forest productivity. Biomass storage was favoured by low- rather than high trait diversity, as most of the biomass is concentrated in species with large stem diameter and high wood density. * Synthesis. Biomass dynamics are mainly shaped by vegetation quantity, and then by vegetation quality, in line with the mass ratio hypothesis. Dry forests show different trait-productivity relationships than wet forests, as stands with ‘slow' trait values are ‘fast' in terms of productivity. Diversity matters, but in a different way than expected; high trait diversity does not enhance productivity, but instead, does low trait diversity enhance carbon storage.},

abstract = {The ability to detect recent natural selection in the human population would have profound implications for the study of human history and for medicine. Here, we introduce a frame- work for detecting the genetic imprint of recent positive selection by analysing long-range haplotypes in human populations. We first identify haplotypes at a locus of interest (core haplotypes). We then assess the age of each core haplotype by the decay of its association to alleles at various distances from the locus, as measured by extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH). Core haplotypes that have unusually high EHH and a high population frequency indicate the presence of a mutation that rose to prominence in the human gene pool faster than expected under neutral evolution.We applied this approach to investigate selec- tion at two genes carrying common variants implicated in resistance to malaria: G6PD1 and CD40 ligand2 . At both loci, the core haplotypes carrying the proposed protective mutation stand out and show significant evidence of selection. More generally, the method could be used to scan the entire genome for evidence of recent positive selection.},

abstract = {Questions: Are patterns of intra- and inter-specific functional trait variation consistent with greater abiotic filtering on community assembly at high latitudes and elevations, and greater biotic filtering at low latitudes and elevations? Locations: Area de Conservaci{\'{o}}n Guanacaste, Costa Rica; Santa Catalina Mountains, Arizona; Siskiyou Mountains, Oregon. Methods: We measured woody plant species abundance and a key functional trait associated with competition for resources and environmental tolerance (specific leaf area, SLA) along elevational gradients in low-latitude tropical (Costa Rica), mid-latitude desert (Arizona) and high latitude mediterranean (southern Oregon) biomes. We explored patterns of abiotic and biotic filtering by comparing observed patterns of community-weighted means and variances along elevational and latitudinal gradients to those expected under random assembly. In addition, we related trait variability to niches and explored how total trait space and breadth vary across broad spatial gradients by quantifying the ratio of intra- to inter-specific variation. Results: Both the community-wide mean and variance of SLA decreased with increasing latitude, consistent with greater abiotic filtering at higher latitudes. Further, low-elevation communities had higher trait variation than expected by chance, consistent with greater biotic filtering at low elevations. Finally, in the tropics and across latitude the ratio of intra- to inter-specific variation was negatively correlated to species richness, which further suggests that biotic interactions influence plant assembly at low latitudes. Conclusions: Intra- and inter-specific patterns of SLA variation appeared broadly consistent with the idea that the relative strength of biotic and abiotic drivers on community assembly changes along elevational and latitudinal gradients; evidence for biotic drivers appeared more prominent at low latitudes and elevations and evidence for abiotic drivers appeared more prominent at high latitudes and elevations. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

Having lain effectively abandoned for many years, community dynamics today is a vibrant research topic of great conceptual interest with practical import for conservation, ecological management, ecosystem services and the responses of ecological communities to climate change. 2.We describe how modern coexistence theory can be applied to predict community dynamics through the use of demography. We explore the challenges that limit the deployment of this demographic framework, and the tools from phylogenetic and functional ecology that have been used to surmount them. 3.Finding existing tools not altogether sufficient, we propose the use of ‘hard' functional traits and physiological tolerances of environmental conditions and low resource availability to extend the demographic framework so that the dynamics of a broader range of ecological communities can be accurately predicted. 4.We illustrate these new approaches with two case studies. Given the urgent need to accurately forecast the dynamics of ecological communities, we hope that many ecologists will adopt these tools.},

@article{Putz2010,
abstract = {While research continues on the causes, consequences, and rates of deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics, there is little agreement about what exactly is being lost, what we want back, and to whom the 'we' refers. Particularly unsettling is that many analyses and well-intended actions are implemented in fogs of ambiguity surrounding definitions of the term 'forest'-a problem that is not solely semantic; with development of markets for biomass carbon, vegetation classification exercises take on new relevance. For example, according to the basic implementation guidelines of the Kyoto Protocol, closed canopy natural forest could be replaced by monoclonal plantations of genetically engineered exotic tree species and no deforestation would have occurred. Following these same guidelines, carbon credits for afforestation could be available for planting trees in species-rich savannas; these new plantations would count towards a country moving towards the 'forest transition,' the point at which there is no net 'forest' loss. Such obvious conflicts between biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration might be avoided if 'forest' was clearly defined and if other vegetation types and other ecosystem values were explicitly recognized. While acknowledging that no one approach to vegetation classification is likely to satisfy all users at all scales, we present an approach that recognizes the importance of species composition, reflects the utility of land-cover characteristics that are identifiable via remote sensing, and acknowledges that many sorts of forest degradation do not reduce carbon stocks (e. g., defaunation) or canopy cover (e. g., over-harvesting of understory nontimber forest products)},

abstract = {Classifying the diverse ways that plants respond to hydrologic stress into generalizable ‘water-use strategies' has long been an eco-physiological research goal. While many schemes for describing water-use strategies have proven to be quite useful, they are also associated with uncertainties regarding their theoretical basis and their connection to plant carbon and water relations. In this review, we discuss the factors that shape plant water stress responses and assess the approaches used to classify a plant's water-use strategy, paying particular attention to the popular but controversial concept of a continuum from isohydry to anisohydry. A generalizable and predictive framework for assessing plant water-use strategies has been historically elusive, yet recent advances in plant physiology and hydraulics provide the field with a way past these obstacles. Specifically, we promote the idea that many metrics that quantify water-use strategies are highly dynamic and emergent from the interaction between plant traits and environmental conditions, and that this complexity has historically hindered the development of a generalizable water-use strategy framework. This idea is explored using a plant hydraulics model to identify: 1) distinct temporal phases in plant hydraulic regulation during drought that underpin dynamic water-use responses, and 2) how variation in both traits and environmental forcings can significantly alter common metrics used to characterize plant water-use strategies. This modeling exercise can bridge the divide between various conceptualizations of water-use strategies and provides targeted hypotheses to advance understanding and quantification of plant water status regulation across spatial and temporal scales. Finally, we describe research frontiers that are necessary to improve the predictive capacity of the plant water-use strategies concept, including further investigation into the belowground determinants of plant water relations, targeted data collection efforts, and the potential to scale these concepts from individuals to whole regions.},

abstract = {Adequately assessing the ecosystem resilience and resistance is a challenging and essential question in the current context of widespread environmental change. Here we suggest the use of a quantitative measure we call Persistence Index (PI) to assess the capacity of communities to maintain their functions and services after disturbances. First, we present the formulation of PI that is based on the diversity, abundance, and redundancy of disturbance- and taxon-specific response traits. Then, we use simulated data sets to study the effects of species richness and the number and frequency of traits on PI values. Finally, we illustrate our approach by assessing the persistence capacity of forest communities in Peninsular Spain and the Balearic Islands in response to fire, drought and windstorm events. The Persistence Index was found to be relatively independent on the number of considered traits, but variable according to the frequency of traits in the community. In the evaluation made with national forest inventory data, PI was found to vary within and among different forest types, being particularly high in stands dominated by non-native species (e.g. Eucalyptus sp.) or in mixed-stands composed by evergreen and deciduous broadleaf species. We also found PI values to increase with the number of species present in the stand, although this relationship saturated due to overlap in species response traits. The presented index is complementary to other approaches developed to study the functional structure of communities through the distribution of species in a functional space. It can be applied to a broad spectrum of communities subjected to different types of stressors, making it a useful tool to guide ecosystem management decisions in a context of changing climate and uncertain disturbance regimes.},

In this work, we expand the DMM to an infinite mixture model (iDMM) and use posterior predictive distributions (PPDs) to explore the performance in three case studies, including two amplicon metagenomic time series. We avoid concentrating on fluctuations within individual taxa and instead focus on consortial-level dynamics, using straight-forward methods for visualizing this perspective. In each study, the iDMM appears to perform well in organizing the data as a framework for biological interpretation. Using the PPDs, we also observe several exceptions where the data appear to significantly depart from the model in ways that give useful ecological insight. We summarize the conclusions as a set of considerations for field researchers: problems with samples and taxa; relevant scales of ecological fluctuation; additional niches as outgroups; and possible violations of niche neutrality.},

Bot. 38: 109-114.A technique for estimating plant water deficits using a relatively inexpensive micrometer to measure leaf thickness was developed. A strong correlation was found between leaf thickness and relative water content (RWC) in Brassica napus, Mirabilis jalapa, Phaseolus vulgaris and Impatiens parviflora. Although leaf thickness at a given RWC varied between plants, it increased linearly with leaf RWC, the rate of change being similar in leaves of plants of the same age and species. Due to this relationship, the construction of a pressure-volume curve makes possible the estimation of leaf water potential. In this case a calibration curve is needed for each population studied or, for the highest accuracy, for each individual. The technique is particularly useful in field conditions where other techniques are not reliable because of difficulties in controlling temperature and where non-destructive measurements are required. {\textcopyright} 1987 Oxford University Press 1987.},

abstract = {Plant genomes are often characterized by a high level of repetitiveness and polyploid nature. Consequently, creating genome assemblies for plant genomes is challenging. The introduction of short-read technologies 10 years ago substantially increased the number of available plant genomes. Generally, these assemblies are incomplete and fragmented, and only a few are at the chromosome scale. Recently, Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore sequencing technologies were commercialized that can sequence long DNA fragments (kilobases to megabase) and, using efficient algorithms, provide high-quality assemblies in terms of contiguity and completeness of repetitive regions1–4. However, even though genome assemblies based on long reads exhibit high contig N50s ({\textgreater}1 Mb), these methods are still insufficient to decipher genome organization at the chromosome level. Here, we describe a strategy based on long reads (MinION or PromethION sequencers) and optical maps (Saphyr system) that can produce chromosome-level assemblies and demonstrate applicability by generating high-quality genome sequences for two new dicotyledon morphotypes, Brassica rapa Z1 (yellow sarson) and Brassica oleracea HDEM (broccoli), and one new monocotyledon, Musa schizocarpa (banana). All three assemblies show contig N50s of {\textgreater}5 Mb and contain scaffolds that represent entire chromosomes or chromosome arms.},

abstract = {1. Indices quantifying the functional aspect of biodiversity are essential in understanding relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and environmental constraints. Many indices of functional diversity have been published but we lack consensus about what indices quantify, how redundant they are and which ones are recommended. 2. This study aims to build a typology of functional diversity indices from artificial data sets encompassing various community structures (different assembly rules, various species richness levels) and to identify a set of independent indices able to discriminate community assembly rules. 3. Our results confirm that indices can be divided into three main categories, each of these corre- sponding to one aspect of functional diversity: functional richness, functional evenness and func- tional divergence.Most published indices are highly correlated and quantify functional richness while quadratic entropy (Q) represents a mix between functional richness and functional diver- gence. Conversely, two indices (FEve and FDiv respectively quantifying functional evenness and functional divergence) are rather independent to all the others. The power analysis revealed that some indices efficiently detect assembly rules while others performed poorly. 4. To accurately assess functional diversity and establish its relationships with ecosystem func- tioning and environmental constraints, we recommend investigating each functional component separately with the appropriate index. Guidelines are provided to help choosing appropriate indices given the issue being investigated. 5. This study demonstrates that functional diversity indices have the potential to reveal the pro- cesses that structure biological communities. Combined with complementary methods (phylo- genetic and taxonomic diversity), the multifaceted framework of functional diversity will help improve our understanding of how biodiversity interacts with ecosystem processes and environ- mental constraints.},

abstract = {Local adaptations can determine the potential of populations to respond to environmental changes, yet adaptive genetic variation is commonly ignored in models forecasting species vulnerability and biogeographical shifts under future climate change. Here we integrate genomic and ecological modeling approaches to identify genetic adaptations associated with climate in two cryptic forest bats. We then incorporate this information directly into forecasts of range changes under future climate change and assessment of population persistence through the spread of climate-adaptive genetic variation (evolutionary rescue potential). Considering climate-adaptive potential reduced range loss projections, suggesting that failure to account for intraspecific variability can result in overestimation of future losses. On the other hand, range overlap between species was projected to increase, indicating that interspecific competition is likely to play an important role in limiting species' future ranges. We show that although evolutionary rescue is possible, it depends on a population's adaptive capacity and connectivity. Hence, we stress the importance of incorporating genomic data and landscape connectivity in climate change vulnerability assessments and conservation management.},

abstract = {Trees are characterized by the large number of seeds they produce. Although most of those seeds will never germinate, plenty will. Of those which germinate, many die young, and eventually, only a minute fraction will grow to adult stage and reproduce. Is this just a random process? Do variations in germination and survival at very young stages rely on variations in adaptations to microgeographic heterogeneity? and do these processes matter at all in determining tree species distribution and abundance?. We have studied these questions with the Neotropical Symphonia tree species. In the Guiana shield, Symphonia are represented by at least two sympatric taxa or ecotypes, Symphonia globulifera found almost exclusively in bottomlands, and a yet undescribed more generalist taxon/ecotype, Symphonia sp1. A reciprocal transplantation experiment (510 seeds, 16 conditions) was set up and followed over the course of 6 years to evaluate the survival and performance of individuals from different ecotypes and provenances. Germination, survival, growth, and herbivory showed signs of local adaptation, with some combinations of ecotypes and provenances growing faster and surviving better in their own habitat or provenance region. S. globulifera was strongly penalized when planted outside its home habitat but showed the fastest growth rates when planted in its home habitat, suggesting it is a specialist of a high-risk high-gain strategy. Conversely, S. sp1 behaved as a generalist, performing well in a variety of environments. The differential performance of seeds and seedlings in the different habitats matches the known distribution of both ecotypes, indicating that environmental filtering at the very early stages can be a key determinant of tree species distributions, even at the microgeographic level and among very closely related taxa. Furthermore, such differential performance also contributes to explain, in part, the maintenance of the different Symphonia ecotypes living in intimate sympatry despite occasional gene flow.},

abstract = {Phenotypic traits and their associated trade-offs have been shown to have globally consistent effects on individual plant physiological functions1–3, but how these effects scale up to influence competition, a key driver of community assembly in terrestrial vegetation, has remained unclear 4. Here we use growth data from more than 3 million trees in over 140,000 plots across the world to show how three key functional traits—wood density, specific leaf area and maximum height—consistently influence competitive interactions. Fast maximum growth of a species was correlated negatively with its wood density in all biomes, and positively with its specific leaf area in most biomes. Low wood density was also correlated with a low ability to tolerate competition and a low competitive effect on neighbours, while high specific leaf area was correlated with a low competitive effect. Thus, traits generate trade-offs between performance with competition versus performance without competition, a fundamental ingredient in the classical hypothesis that the coexistence of plant species is enabled via differentiation in their successional strategies5. Competition within species was stronger than between species, but an increase in trait dissimilarity between species had little influence in weakening competition. No benefit of dissimilarity was detected for specific leaf area or wood density, and only a weak benefit for maximum height. Our trait- based approach to modelling competition makes generalization possible across the forest ecosystems of the world and their highly diverse species composition.},

abstract = {Key message: Abundant Neotropical canopy-tree species are more resistant to drought-induced branch embolism than what is currently admitted. Large hydraulic safety margins protect them from hydraulic failure under actual drought conditions. Context: Xylem vulnerability to embolism, which is associated to survival under extreme drought conditions, is being increasingly studied in the tropics, but data on the risk of hydraulic failure for lowland Neotropical rainforest canopy-tree species, thought to be highly vulnerable, are lacking. Aims: The purpose of this study was to gain more knowledge on species drought-resistance characteristics in branches and leaves and the risk of hydraulic failure of abundant rainforest canopy-tree species during the dry season. Methods: We first assessed the range of branch xylem vulnerability to embolism using the flow-centrifuge technique on 1-m-long sun-exposed branches and evaluated hydraulic safety margins with leaf turgor loss point and midday water potential during normal- and severe-intensity dry seasons for a large set of Amazonian rainforest canopy-tree species. Results: Tree species exhibited a broad range of embolism resistance, with the pressure threshold inducing 50{\%} loss of branch hydraulic conductivity varying from − 1.86 to − 7.63 MPa. Conversely, we found low variability in leaf turgor loss point and dry season midday leaf water potential, and mostly large, positive hydraulic safety margins. Conclusions: Rainforest canopy-tree species growing under elevated mean annual precipitation can have high resistance to embolism and are more resistant than what was previously thought. Thanks to early leaf turgor loss and high embolism resistance, most species have a low risk of hydraulic failure and are well able to withstand normal and even severe dry seasons.},

abstract = {Due to high biodiversity in tropical rainforests, tree species are aggregated into functional groups for modelling purposes. In this article the influences of two different classifications of tropical tree species into functional groups on the output of a rainforest model are analysed. The FORMIND model is documented. FORMIND simulates the tree growth of tropical rainforests. The model is individual-based and developed from the FORMIX3 model. In the model, trees compete for light and space in plots of 20 x 20 m in size. A carbon balance is calculated based on the processes of photosynthesis and respiration. Using a tree geometry submodel, typical tree variables (e.g. diameter, height, crown length) are calculated. The mortality process is mainly driven by falling trees and the canopy gaps they create. Trees of the same functional group and diameter class are represented in one cohort. Simulation results for a primary lowland dipterocarp rainforest in Sabah, Malaysia, are discussed. Detailed structural characteristics of the rainforest stands can be analysed, e.g. the simulation results support the hypothesis that rainforests grow in a layer structure. A comparison of results for the aggregation of 436 tree species into five or 22 functional groups respectively, shows that typical results, such as total stem volume or crown closure, achieved with five groups are as accurate as simulations with a huge number of groups. However, some features such as interspecific competition can only be analysed with a huge number (e.g. 22) of functional groups. The model has the potential to analyse extinction processes and spatial structure of gap formations in rainforests. The analysis of logging scenarios could estimate the effects of human impacts in tropical rainforests.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Ecologists have long been puzzled by the fact that there are so many similar species in nature. Here we show that self-organized clusters of look-a-likes may emerge spontaneously from coevolution of competitors. The explanation is that there are two alternative ways to survive together: being sufficiently different or being sufficiently similar. Using a model based on classical competition theory, we demonstrate a tendency for evolutionary emergence of regularly spaced lumps of similar species along a niche axis. Indeed, such lumpy patterns are commonly observed in size distributions of organisms ranging from algae, Zooplankton, and beetles to birds and mammals, and could not be well explained by earlier theory. Our results suggest that these patterns may represent self-constructed niches emerging from competitive interactions. A corollary of our findings is that, whereas in species-poor communities sympatric speciation and invasion of open niches is possible, species-saturated communities may be characterized by convergent evolution and invasion by look-a-likes. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {A challenge for eco-evolutionary research is to better understand the effect of climate and landscape changes on species and their distribution. Populations of species can respond to changes in their environment through local genetic adaptation or plasticity, dispersal, or local extinction. The individual-based modeling (IBM) approach has been repeatedly applied to assess organismic responses to environmental changes. IBMs simulate emerging adaptive behaviors from the basic entities upon which both ecological and evolutionary mechanisms act. The objective of this review is to summarize the state of the art of eco-evolutionary IBMs and to explore to what degree they already address the key responses of organisms to environmental change. In this, we identify promising approaches and potential knowledge gaps in the implementation of eco-evolutionary mechanisms to motivate future research. Using mainly the ISI Web of Science, we reveal that most of the progress in eco-evolutionary IBMs in the last decades was achieved for genetic adaptation to novel local environmental conditions. There is, however, not a single eco-evolutionary IBM addressing the three potential adaptive responses simultaneously. Additionally, IBMs implementing adaptive phenotypic plasticity are rare. Most commonly, plasticity was implemented as random noise or reaction norms. Our review further identifies a current lack of models where plasticity is an evolving trait. Future eco-evolutionary models should consider dispersal and plasticity as evolving traits with their associated costs and benefits. Such an integrated approach could help to identify conditions promoting population persistence depending on the life history strategy of organisms and the environment they experience.},

Inferring the processes generating such patterns is difficult, and may require consideration of emergent and non-linear properties of speciation, such as when small changes at tipping points have large effects on differentiation. Tipping points involve positive feedback and indirect selection stemming from associations between genomic regions, bi-stability due to effects of initial conditions and evolutionary history, and dependence on modularity of system components. These features are associated with sudden ‘regime shifts' in other cellular, ecological, and societal systems. Thus, tools used to understand other complex systems could be fruitfully applied in speciation research.},

Beta diversity—the turnover of community composition in space and time—has received particular attention. Here, I discuss recent findings in spatial and temporal turnover along abiotic and biotic gradients at two different extents. Turnover in space and time seem to exhibit similar scale dependency along latitudinal gradients; turnover is faster in the tropics at narrow study extents, but the pattern is reversed at broad extents as turnover accelerates nearer to the poles. Moreover, organisms at high trophic positions have higher turnover rates in space at broad study extents than do organisms at low trophic positions, but trophic position does not affect temporal turnover rates. Future studies that simultaneously examine variation in community composition in space, time, and along environmental gradients would shed more light on the mechanistic basis of community organization.},

We find expansions of gene families specifically associated with ion and water regulation, highlighting adaptation to variation in salinity. We further generate a genome-wide variation map through RAD-sequencing of Atlantic and Mediterranean populations. We show that variation in local recombination rates strongly influences the genomic landscape of diversity within and differentiation between lineages. Comparing predictions of alternative demographic models to the joint allele-frequency spectrum indicates that genomic islands of differentiation between sea bass lineages were generated by varying rates of introgression across the genome following a period of geographical isolation.},

abstract = {Logged tropical forests represent a major opportunity for preserving biodiversity and sequestering carbon, playing a large role in meeting global forest restoration targets. Left alone, these ecosystems have been expected to undergo natural regeneration and succession towards old growth forests, but extreme drought events may challenge this process. While old growth forests possess a certain level of resilience, we lack understanding as to how logging may affect forest responses to drought. This study examines the drought-logging interaction in seedling dynamics within a landscape of logged and unlogged forests in Sabah Malaysia, based on 73 plots monitored before and after the 2015-16 El Nino drought. Drought increased seedling mortality in all forests, but the magnitude of this impact was modulated by logging intensity, with forests with lower canopy leaf area index and above-ground biomass experiencing greater drought induced mortality. Moreover, community traits in more heavily logged forests shifted towards being more ruderal after drought, suggesting that the trajectory of forest succession had been reversed. These results indicate that with reoccurring strong droughts under a changing climate, logged forests that have had over half of their biomass removed may suffer permanently arrested succession. Targeted management interventions may therefore be necessary to lift the vulnerable forests above the biomass threshold.},

A previous study based on plastid ndhF and trnL - F genes supported the monophyly of Corythophora but suggested that Eschweilera and Lecythis are not monophyletic. Using this study as a baseline, we sampled more taxa and sequenced more loci to address the taxonomic problems of the ambiguous genera and to determine relationships within the Bertholletia clade. Our results support the monophyly of the Bertholletia clade as previously circumscribed. In addition, Corythophora is monophyletic, and the two accessions of Bertholletia excelsa come out together on the tree. Results of the simultaneous analysis do not support the monophyly of Lecythis or Eschweilera .

abstract = {The phenotypic responses of functional traits in natural populations are driven by genetic diversity and phenotypic plasticity. These two mechanisms enable trees to cope with rapid climate change. We studied two European temperate tree species (sessile oak and European beech), focusing on (i) in situ variations of leaf functional traits (morphological and physiological) along two altitudinal gradients and (ii) the extent to which these variations were under environmental and/or genetic control using a common garden experiment. For all traits, altitudinal trends tended to be highly consistent between species and transects. For both species, leaf mass per area displayed a positive linear correlation with altitude, whereas leaf size was negatively correlated with altitude. We also observed a significant increase in leaf physiological performance with increasing altitude: populations at high altitudes had higher maximum rates of assimilation, stomatal conductance and leaf nitrogen content than those at low altitudes. In the common garden experiment, genetic differentiation between populations accounted for 0-28{\%} of total phenotypic variation. However, only two traits (leaf mass per area and nitrogen content) exhibited a significant cline. The combination of in situ and common garden experiments used here made it possible to demonstrate, for both species, a weaker effect of genetic variation than of variations in natural conditions, suggesting a strong effect of the environment on leaf functional traits. Finally, we demonstrated that intrapopulation variability was systematically higher than interpopulation variability, whatever the functional trait considered, indicating a high potential capacity to adapt to climate change.},

Efforts to evaluate proposed mechanisms have been hampered by a lack of comparative data on species' reactions to relevant axes of environmental variation. Here we show that differential drought sensitivity shapes plant distributions in tropical forests at both regional and local scales. Our analyses are based on experimental field assessments of drought sensitivity of 48 species of trees and shrubs, and on their local and regional distributions within a network of 122 inventory sites spanning a rainfall gradient across the Isthmus of Panama. Our results suggest that niche differentiation with respect to soil water availability is a direct determinant of both local- and regional-scale distributions of tropical trees. Changes in soil moisture availability caused by global climate change and forest fragmentation are therefore likely to alter tropical species distributions, community composition and diversity. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

In the system domain, a formal definition and quantification of the concept of resilience has been elusive. This paper proposes generic metrics and formulae for quantifying system resilience. The discussions and graphical examples illustrate that the quantitative model is aligned with the fundamental concept of resilience. Based on the approach presented it is possible to analyze resilience as a time dependent function in the context of systems. The paper describes the metrics of network and system resilience, time for resilience and total cost of resilience. Also the paper describes the key parameters necessary to analyze system resilience such as the following: disruptive events, component restoration and overall resilience strategy. A road network example is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed resilience metrics and how these analyses form the basis for developing effective resilience design strategies. The metrics described are generic enough to be implemented in a variety of applications as long as appropriate figures-of-merit and the necessary system parameters, system decomposition and component parameters are defined. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Aim Tropical elevation gradients are natural laboratories to assess how changing climate can influence tropical forests. However, there is a need for theory and integrated data collection to scale from traits to ecosystems. We assess predictions of a novel trait-based scaling theory, including whether observed shifts in forest traits across a broad tropical temperature gradient are consistent with local phenotypic optima and adaptive compensation for temperature. Location An elevation gradient spanning 3,300 m and consisting of thousands of tropical tree trait measures taken from 16 1-ha tropical forest plots in southern Per{\'{u}}, where gross and net primary productivity (GPP and NPP) were measured. Time period April to November 2013. Major taxa studied Plants; tropical trees. Methods We developed theory to scale from traits to communities and ecosystems and tested several predictions. We assessed the covariation between climate, traits, biomass and GPP and NPP. We measured multiple traits linked to variation in tree growth and assessed their frequency distributions within and across the elevation gradient. We paired these trait measures across individuals within 16 forests with simultaneous measures of ecosystem net and gross primary productivity. Results Consistent with theory, variation in forest NPP and GPP primarily scaled with forest biomass, but the secondary effect of temperature on productivity was much less than expected. This weak temperature dependence appears to reflect directional shifts in several mean community traits that underlie tree growth with decreases in site temperature. Main conclusions The observed shift in traits of trees that dominate in more cold environments is consistent with an ‘adaptive/acclimatory' compensation for the kinetic effects of temperature on leaf photosynthesis and tree growth. Forest trait distributions across the gradient showed overly peaked and skewed distributions, consistent with the importance of local filtering of optimal growth traits and recent shifts in species composition and dominance attributable to warming from climate change. Trait-based scaling theory provides a basis to predict how shifts in climate have and will influence the trait composition and ecosystem functioning of tropical forests.},

abstract = {Background Managed forests are a major component of tropical landscapes. Production forests as designated by national forest services cover up to 400 million ha, i.e. half of the forested area in the humid tropics. Forest management thus plays a major role in the global carbon budget, but with a lack of unified method to estimate carbon fluxes from tropical managed forests. In this study we propose a new time- and spatially-explicit methodology to estimate the above-ground carbon budget of selective logging at regional scale. Results The yearly balance of a logging unit, i.e. the elementary management unit of a forest estate, is modelled by aggregating three sub-models encompassing (i) emissions from extracted wood, (ii) emissions from logging damage and deforested areas and (iii) carbon storage from post-logging recovery. Models are parametrised and uncertainties are propagated through a MCMC algorithm. As a case study, we used 38 years of National Forest Inventories in French Guiana, northeastern Amazonia, to estimate the above-ground carbon balance (i.e. the net carbon exchange with the atmosphere) of selectively logged forests. Over this period, the net carbon balance of selective logging in the French Guianan Permanent Forest Estate is estimated to be comprised between 0.12 and 1.33 Tg C, with a median value of 0.64 Tg C. Uncertainties over the model could be diminished by improving the accuracy of both logging damage and large woody necromass decay submodels. Conclusions We propose an innovating carbon accounting framework relying upon basic logging statistics. This flexible tool allows carbon budget of tropical managed forests to be estimated in a wide range of tropical regions.},

abstract = {The evolutionary potential of long-lived species, such as forest trees, is fundamental for their local persistence under climate change (CC). Genome-environment association (GEA) analyses reveal if species in heterogeneous environments at the regional scale are under differential selection resulting in populations with potential preadaptation to CC within this area. In 79 natural Fagus sylvatica populations, neutral genetic patterns were characterized using 12 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, and genomic variation (144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) out of 52 candidate genes) was related to 87 environmental predictors in the latent factor mixed model, logistic regressions and isolation by distance/environmental (IBD/IBE) tests. SSR diversity revealed relatedness at up to 150 m intertree distance but an absence of large-scale spatial genetic structure and IBE. In the GEA analyses, 16 SNPs in 10 genes responded to one or several environmental predictors and IBE, corrected for IBD, was confirmed. The GEA often reflected the proposed gene functions, including indications for adaptation to water availability and temperature. Genomic divergence and the lack of large-scale neutral genetic patterns suggest that gene flow allows the spread of advantageous alleles in adaptive genes. Thereby, adaptation processes are likely to take place in species occurring in heterogeneous environments, which might reduce their regional extinction risk under CC.},

@article{Aarssen1983,
abstract = {The common assumption that species coexistence in nature can be generally explained by processes of natural selection for niche differentiation does not have strong empirical support for plants. The meaning of competitive ability has traditionally been embedded within an Eltonian view of the niche. In particular reference to plants, however, a true distinction between the meanings of niche and competitive ability is established based on the premise that for one species to competitively exclude another, two distinct conditions must be satisfied: (1) There must be a sufficient degree of overlap in the niche requirements of the two species; and (2) one species must be sufficiently superior at reducing the availability of resources to the other. Following these considerations an evolutionary theory of coexistence is proposed involving two alternative mechanisms based on a broader interpretation of the operation of natural selection in systems of competition than previously recognized. Competitive exclusion may be avoided either if natural selection results in niche differentiation (selection for ecological combining ability), or if reciprocal selection maintains a balance of competitive abilities (selection for competitive combining ability). Competitive combining ability, although previously overlooked, has wide applicability to plants for which coexistence frequently is explained incompletely by ecological combining ability. The main argument is as follows: All biological attributes of a species will play a part in determining its niche requirements on the one hand, and its relative competitive ability for those requirements on the other. Given the assumption that niche requirements generally overlap broadly in plants, I propose that coexistence is permitted because there are numerous possible permutations and combinations of biological attributes in plants which are roughly equivalent in the overall competitive power which they confer. In selection for competitive combining ability, these attribute complexes are continually adjusted in an ongoing process of coevolution in which local neighborhoods are constantly engaged in a fine-tuning process that alters the way members respond to one another. Consequently, natural selection ultimately maintains a balance of overall relative competitive abilities between two species for essentially the same contested resources. I discuss the relevance of this mechanism and its relationship to other theories and concepts associated with coexistence in contexts of competition. It is proposed that, in nature, selection for ecological combining ability and selection for competitive combining ability operate in concert, and this provides reconciliation of the contradiction in theory between convergent adaptation to a common habitat and divergent adaptation to other members of the community.},

abstract = {Interest in, and opportunities to include functional and phylogenetic attributes of species in community ecology and biogeography are rapidly growing and seen as vital for the assessment of status and trends in biodiversity. However, the fundamental underlying evidence remains the (co-)occurrence of the biological units, such as species, in time and space and our ability to appropriately detect and quantify them. Here, we examine the implications of imperfect detection of species for functional and phylogenetic diversity (FD and PD) estimates. We explore how FD and PD might have different detectabilities than taxonomic diversity (TD) and how all three might vary differently along spatial and environmental gradients. We also extend occupancy modeling and dendrogram-based methods to address the imperfect detection of different biodiversity facets. Trait-based and phylogenetic attributes of species are increasingly seen as vital components to better address the processes underlying spatial and temporal biodiversity dynamics and the potential consequences of biodiversity change.A rapid growth in phylogenetic trees and trait compilations has led to an increase in phylogentic and functional diversity studies and resulted in numerous applications, including evaluating impacts of global change, setting conservation targets, and mapping ecosystem services.All diversity metrics remain limited by our ability to measure them in the field. The fundamental unit (the presence or abundance of a single species) is rarely perfectly captured and measurement quality varies by species, environments, and traits.The potential consequences of this imperfect detection for functional or phylogenetic diversity have to date remained unexamined.},

abstract = {Recent decades have been characterized by increasing temperatures worldwide, resulting in an exponential climb in vapor pressure deficit (VPD). VPD has been identified as an increasingly important driver of plant functioning in terrestrial biomes and has been established as a major contributor in recent drought-induced plant mortality independent of other drivers associated with climate change. Despite this, few studies have isolated the physiological response of plant functioning to high VPD, thus limiting our understanding and ability to predict future impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. An abundance of evidence suggests that stomatal conductance declines under high VPD and transpiration increases in most species up until a given VPD threshold, leading to a cascade of subsequent impacts including reduced photosynthesis and growth, and higher risks of carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. Incorporation of photosynthetic and hydraulic traits in ‘next-generation' land-surface models has the greatest potential for improved prediction of VPD responses at the plant- and global-scale, and will yield more mechanistic simulations of plant responses to a changing climate. By providing a fully integrated framework and evaluation of the impacts of high VPD on plant function, improvements in forecasting and long-term projections of climate impacts can be made.},

abstract = {The forest soils of northern French Guiana provide illustrations of a wide range of pedogenetic processes typical of tropical rainforest environments. The pores of the deep-seated rock are fully saturated by the ground water, producing saprolite. Further up, the alternation of wetting and dessication has redistributed the iron forming a mottled appearance and varied facies. In the upper horizons, due to the even more extreme water regime, organic material uptake and biological activity, the constituents continue to be weathered and undergo substantial remodelling; a major mechanism is iron depletion that varies considerably depending on the topography, sometimes to the extent of being wholly eliminated by podzolisation. A distinction is made between four major types of soil mantle and six types of water regimes, characterised in particular by the extreme variability of the water-logging constraint. The deep, very well internally drained soils are inherited from ancient climatic eras that were less humid. The shallow soils on many slopes are the result of a lowering of the watershed, which is thought to have been caused by a slight tectonic lift.},

abstract = {1. Experimental studies have provided significant knowledge of how biodiversity can influence ecosystem processes. However, there is a growing need to relate these findings to natural communities. 2. Here we identify two major hypotheses for how communities may influence ecosystem processes: the 'diversity hypothesis' (the diversity of organisms in a community influences ecosystem processes through mechanisms such as complementary resource use), and the 'mass ratio hypothesis' (ecosystem processes are determined overwhelmingly by the functional traits of the dominant species). We then test which of these two hypotheses best explain variation in ecosystem properties and processes (biomass pools and fluxes, water use, light interception) in a temperate native grassland. We do this by applying various measures of diversity, functional diversity, and functional identity, whose significant relations with ecosystem processes would support either of the competing hypotheses. 3. Mean trait values best explained variation in five of the eight ecosystem processes examined, supporting Grime's mass ratio hypothesis, which proposes that the functional identities of the dominant species largely determine ecosystem processes. 4. Multi-trait functional diversity indices also explained large amounts of variation in ecosystem processes, while only weak relationships were observed between species richness and ecosystem processes. 5. To explore the mechanistic interactions between variables, we developed structural equation models (SEMs), which indicated that many of the community diversity and trait properties significantly influenced ecosystem processes, even after accounting for co-varying biotic/abiotic factors. 6. Synthesis. Our study is one of the first explicit comparisons of the 'diversity' and 'mass ratio' hypotheses, and our results most strongly support the mass ratio hypothesis, that is, the traits of the dominant species most influenced the ecosystem properties and processes examined. Our results suggest that the management of communities for the maintenance of ecosystem processes should focus on species dominance hierarchies.},

We used: (1) five methods to create bS-SDM predictions; (2) two approaches for predicting species richness, by summing individual SDM probabilities or by modelling the number of species (i.e. richness) directly; and (3) five different biotic rules based either on ranking probabilities from SDMs or on community co-occurrence patterns.

abstract = {1 It is useful to distinguish between the immediate effects of species richness on ecosystems and those which become apparent on a longer time scale, described here as filter and founder effects. 2 Relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties can be explored by classifying component species into three categories – dominants, subordinates and transients. Dominants recur in particular vegetation types, are relatively large, exhibit coarse-grained foraging for resources and, as individual species, make a substantial contribution to the plant biomass. Subordinates also show high fidelity of association with particular vegetation types but they are smaller in stature, forage on a more restricted scale and tend to occupy microhabitats delimited by the architecture and phenology of their associated dominants. Transients comprise a heterogeneous assortment of species of low abundance and persistence; a high proportion are juveniles of species that occur as dominants or subordinates in neighbouring ecosystems. 3 A ‘mass ratio' theory proposes that immediate controls are in proportion to inputs to primary production, are determined to an overwhelming extent by the traits and functional diversity of the dominant plants and are relatively insensitive to the richness of subordinates and transients. Recent experiments support the mass ratio hypothesis and the conclusion of Huston (1997) that claims of immediate benefits of high species richness to ecosystem functions arise from misinterpretation of data. 4 Attribution of immediate control to dominants does not exclude subordinates and transients from involvement in the determination of ecosystem function and sustainability. Both are suspected to play a crucial, if intermittent, role by influencing the recruitment of dominants. Some subordinates may act as a filter influencing regeneration by dominants following major perturbations. 5 Transients originate from the seed rain and seed banks and provide an index of the pool of potential dominants and subordinates at specific sites. Where the landscape carousel operates against a background of declining diversity in the reservoir of colonizing transients, we may predict that a progressive loss of ecosystem functions will arise from the decline in the precision with which dominants can engage in the re-assembly and relocation of ecosystems.},

abstract = {Despite slow nutrient supply to the subtropical surface ocean, the rates of annual inorganic carbon uptake and net oxygen production are similar to those of nutrient-rich high-latitude waters. This surprisingly high subtropical carbon uptake cannot be fully accounted for by sediment trap-collected sinking particles and the downward mixing of suspended and dissolved organic carbon. We propose an explanation for these paradoxical observations: gel-like organic matter rich in carbon but poor in nutrients, akin to transparent exopolymer particles, is produced by phytoplankton under nutrient limitation, and a portion sinks into the shallow subsurface, where it is respired by heterotrophic bacteria. This organic matter would evade detection by sediment traps, effectively representing an additional (sinking-driven) source of dissolved organic carbon to the subsurface. Building on existing evidence for the production of such nutrient-poor organic matter in surface waters, we describe evidence for its decomposition in the shallow subsurface of the Sargasso Sea. First, oxygen at these depths is consumed over the summer without comparable production of nitrate. Second, a seasonal change in the},

abstract = {Sympatric speciation, the origin of two or more species from a single local population, has almost certainly been involved in formation of several species flocks, and may be fairly common in nature. The most straightforward scenario for sympatric speciation requires disruptive selection favouring two substantially different phenotypes, and consists of the evolution of reproductive isolation between them followed by the elimination of all intermediate phenotypes. Here we use the hypergeometric phenotypic model to show that sympatric speciation is possible even when fitness and mate choice depend on different quantitative traits, so that speciation must involve formation of covariance between these traits. The increase in the number of variable loci affecting fitness facilitates sympatric speciation, whereas the increase in the number of variable loci affecting mate choice has the opposite effect. These predictions may enable more cases of sympatric speciation to be identified.},

abstract = {A spatial and mechanistic model is developed for the dynamics of transition oak-northern hardwoods forests in northeastern North America. The purpose of the model is to extrapolate from measurable fine-scale and short-term interactions among individual trees to large-scale and long-term dynamics of forest communities. Field methods, statistical estimators, and model structure were designed simultaneously to ensure that parameters could be estimated from data collected in the field. This paper documents eight aspects of a three-year study to calibrate, test, and analyze the model for the nine dominant and subdominant tree species in transition oak-northern hardwoods forests: 1) Design and structure of the model. The model makes population dynamic forecasts by predicting the fate of every individual tree throughout its life. Species-specific functions predict each tree's dispersal, establishment, growth, mortality, and fecundity. Trees occupy unique spatial positions, and individual performance is affected by the local availability of resources. Competition is mechanistic; resources available to each tree are reduced by neighbors. Although the model was developed to include light, water, and nitrogen, the version described here includes only competition for light (shading and light-dependent performance) because the field data provide little evidence of competition for nitrogen and water over the range of sites examined. 2) Estimates of the model's parameters for each species. The estimates reveal a variety of "strategic trade-offs" among the species. For example, species that grow quickly under high light tend to cast relatively little shade, have low survivorship under low light, and have high dispersal. In contrast, species that grow slowly under high light tend to cast relatively dark shade, and to have high survivorship under low light and low dispersal. These trade-offs define one of two dominant "axes" of strategic variation. 3) Community level predictions of the model. The model predicts succession from early dominance by species such as Quercus rubra and Prunus serotina, to late dominance by Fagus grandifolia and Tsuga canadensis, with Betula alleganiensis present as a gap phase species in old-growth stands. The model also predicts that old-growth communities will have intraspecifically clumped and interspecifically segregated spatial distributions. 4) An error analysis that identifies community level predictions that are robust given the level of sampling uncertainty in the study. This analysis translates the statistical uncertainty associated with each parameter estimate into statistical uncertainty in the model's predictions. The robust predictions include those mentioned in aspect (3) above. 5) Sensitivity of the model to changes in initial conditions and to changes in the three parameters not included in the error analysis. For example, the model predicts that initial abundances continue to affect community composition well into succession ({\textgreater} 300 yr for some species). 6) Tests of the system- and community-level predictions of the model against independent data gleaned from other studies. These tests support the predictions found to be robust in the error analysis, including those predictions mentioned in aspect (3) above. 7) Modeling experiments that determine which aspects of individual performance and inter-neighbor competition are responsible for each of the robust predictions identified in aspect (4) above and tested in aspect (6) above. This analysis reveals a wide variety of causal relationships, with most parameters contributing to at least one community level phenomenon. 8) An explanation of the diversity of individual level causes identified in aspect (7). The two "axes" describing most of the strategic variation among the species (see [2]), provide a simple explanation of community level pattern in terms of individual level processes.},

abstract = {We surveyed the literature published since 1985 for evidence of natural selection and heritability in vegetative functional traits and performance. Our goals were to (1) review patterns of selection on specific functional traits and (2) assess general evolutionary questions about selection and heritability for broad classes of traits. While generalizations about the functional significance of specific traits are premature, several functional hypotheses are supported. For example, herbivores can exert strong selection on secondary chemistry and mechanical defenses, but costs of resistance and negative correlations between defense traits may constrain their evolution. Competitive interactions select for early germination and favor stem elongation and shifts in flowering time where such responses actually minimize competitive effects. In the very few studies of physiology, selection on gas exchange and leaf size is clearly environment dependent. More generally, in reciprocal transplant experiments, populations often are locally adapted, and selection favors the native phenotype. These results suggest that selection is important in functional trait evolution and population differentiation. At the same time, selection often varies in space and time and across life-history episodes. This variation could slow the rate of evolutionary change, maintain genetic variation within populations, and select for plasticity. Analyses of general questions revealed that indirect selection through correlated characters accounts for a substantial portion of total selection on traits and often appears to reinforce the pattern of direct selection. This could be due to environmental effects on multiple phenotypic traits and fitness. Alternatively, indirect selection could contribute to the rapid evolution of suites of traits. We found only weak evidence that traits under strong selection have low heritability, a pattern that has been reported for animals and predicted by some theory. Thus, the rate of evolutionary change may well differ among traits. The strength of selection also depended on the fitness measure, being stronger selection through cumulative fitness than fertility or vegetative performance. Attributes of species' biology and experimental design affected selection and heritability estimates. Heritability was lower in inbreeding species relative to outbreeders, as expected. Heritabilities in controlled environments substantially overestimate estimates from the wild and should not be used as reliable predictors of the rate of adaptive evolutionary change in natural populations. Likewise, broad-sense heritability overestimates narrow-sense heritability and is thus unreliable for predicting evolutionary change in outbreeding species. Future studies of functional trait evolution should focus on physiology and a broader array of phenological and developmental traits. Long-lived species are severely underrepresented in microevolutionary studies, no doubt for practical reasons. Finally, an emphasis should be placed on exploring the nature and effect of trait interactions on fitness, since these are likely to be very important in shaping the course of evolution.},

abstract = {1. Many hypotheses about species coexistence involve differential resource use and trade-offs in species' life-history traits. Quantifying resource use across most species in diverse communities, although, has seldom been attempted.2. We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to quantify the light dependence of recruitment in 263 woody species in a 50-ha long-term forest census plot in Panama. Data on sapling recruitment were obtained using the 1985–1990 and 1990–1995 census intervals. Available light was estimated for each recruit from yearly censuses of canopy density.3. We use a power function (linear log–log relationship) to model the light effect on recruitment. Different responses of recruitment to light are expressed by the light effect parameter b. The distribution of b had a central mode at 0.8, suggesting that recruitment of many species responds nearly linearly to increasing light.4. Nearly every species showed increases in recruitment with increasing light. Just nine species (3{\%}) had recruitment declining with light, while 198 species (75{\%}) showed increasing recruitment in both census intervals. Most of the increases in recruitment were decelerating, i.e. the increase was less at higher light (b {\textless} 1). In the remaining species, the response to light varied between census intervals (24 species) or species did not have recruits in both intervals (41 species).5. Synthesis. Nearly all species regenerate better in higher light, and recruitment responses to light are spread along a continuum ranging from modest increase with light to a rather strict requirement for high light. These results support the hypothesis that spatio-temporal variation in light availability may contribute to the diversity of tropical tree species by providing opportunities for niche differentiation with respect to light requirements for regeneration.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

Because they differ in several features from the pervasive vertebrate-human model, plants have been considered as complicating the question.

Because some plant features are supposed to pose a threat to individual genetic homogeneity, higher heterogeneity has been assumed for plants compared to animals.Moreover, individual plants are sometimes identified with communities. How does this supposed heterogeneity appear in particular species? Cultivated plants exhibit distinctive diversity, and their overrepresentation in the study of plant diversity might bias the way plant individuality is understood. Just as there is a vertebrate bias, there may also be a cultivated plant bias. Recent results bring plants much closer to animals in terms of cellular functioning, so plants might not be so different from animals with respect to their diversity, and consequently their individuality.},

Consequently, these ecosystems are extremely important components of Earth's climatic system and biogeochemical cycles. Plant hydraulics is an essential discipline to understand and predict the dynamics of tropical vegetation in scenarios of changing water availability. Using published plant hydraulic data we show that the trade‐off between drought avoidance (expressed as deep‐rooting, deciduousness and capacitance) and hydraulic safety (P50) is a major axis of physiological variation across tropical ecosystems. We also propose a novel and independent axis of hydraulic trait variation linking vulnerability to hydraulic failure (expressed as the hydraulic safety margin‐HSM) and growth, where inherent fast‐growing plants have lower HSM compared to slow‐growing plants. We surmise that soil nutrients are fundamental drivers of tropical community assembly determining the distribution and abundance of the slow‐safe/fast‐risky strategies. We conclude showing that including either the growth‐HSM or the resistance‐avoidance trade‐off in models can make simulated tropical rainforest communities substantially more vulnerable to drought than similar communities without the trade‐off.

abstract = {A central current debate in community ecology concerns the relative importance of deterministic versus stochastic processes underlying community structure. However, the concept of stochasticity presents several profound philosophical, theoretical and empirical challenges, which we address here. The philosophical argument that nothing in nature is truly stochastic can be met with the following operational concept of neutral stochasticity in community ecology: change in the composition of a community (i.e. community dynamics) is neutrally stochastic to the degree that individual demographic events – birth, death, immigration, emigration – which cause such changes occur at random with respect to species identities. Empirical methods for identifying the stochastic component of community dynamics or structure include null models and multivariate statistics on observational species-by-site data (with or without environmental or trait data), and experimental manipulations of ‘stochastic' species colonization order or relative densities and frequencies of competing species. We identify the fundamental limitations of each method with respect to its ability to allow inferences about stochastic community processes. Critical future needs include greater precision in articulating the link between results and ecological inferences, a comprehensive theoretical assessment of the interpretation of statistical analyses of observational data, and experiments focusing on community size and on natural variation in species colonization order.},

Mayr and by B. Rensch. The concept is of great utility in many studies of evolution and zoogeography. The use of superspecies has been somewhat retarded by the absence of any formalized notation for them in Linnaean nomenclature. It is here proposed that brackets(= square parentheses) enclose the first named species of a superspecies: thus, superspecies Bubo [bubo], or Bubo [bubo] virginianus to indicate that the species virginianus is a member of the superspecies Bubo [bubo]. The term "allospecies" is suggested for the species comprising a superspecies.

Additive partitioning methodologies were adopted to detect phenomenological patterns in the productivity data, and the trait structure of mixed communities was used to advance insights into compositional effects. 3.After six years of plantation development, biomass productivity was significantly higher in mixtures compared to the monocultures of component species. We observed that processes operated through direct tree-tree interactions, since the diversity signal disappeared where trees in mixed stands were surrounded by conspecific neighbours only. This result is particularly relevant for mixed-species planation systems, as trees are commonly planted in monospecific patches to simplify management. Partitioning unveiled strong selection effects at both plantation sites. However, at the harsh Ged-site this was caused by competitive dominance of species with fast young growth whereas at the benign Zed-site, species with slow young growth improved their performances but not at the expense of others (i.e., trait-dependent complementarity). Species tolerance to shading is an influential trait for predicting biodiversity effects, with community-weighted means in shade tolerance mediating dominance effects (Ged) and functional diversity in shade tolerance mediating (trait-dependent) complementarity effects (Zed). 4.Synthesis. This study highlights that biodiversity effects in young tree plantations could be explained by the functional composition of mixed communities, with a key role for species levels of shade tolerance. As contrasting results between plantation sites were observed, future research should target the context-dependency of DPRs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Uncovering the genetic and evolutionary basis of local adaptation is a major focus of evolutionary biology. The recent development of cost-effective methods for obtaining high-quality genomescale data makes it possible to identify some of the loci responsible for adaptive differences among populations. Two basic approaches for identifying putatively locally adaptive loci have been developed and are broadly used: one that identifies loci with unusually high genetic differentiation among populations (differentiation outliermethods) and one that searches for correlations between local population allele frequencies and local environments (genetic-environment association methods). Here, we review the promises and challenges of these genome scanmethods, including correcting for the confounding influence of a species' demographic history, biases caused by missing aspects of the genome, matching scales of environmental data with population structure, and other statistical considerations. In each case, we make suggestions for best practices for maximizing the accuracy and efficiency of genome scans to detect the underlying genetic basis of local adaptation. With attention to their current limitations, genome scan methods can be an important tool in finding the genetic basis of adaptive evolutionary change.},

abstract = {In the past, explanations for high species diversity have been sought at the species level. Theory shows that coexistence requires substantial differences between species, but species-level data rarely provide evidence for such differences. Using data from forests in the southeastern United States, I show here that variation evident at the individual level provides for coexistence of large numbers of competitors. Variation among individuals within populations allows species to differ in their distributions of responses to the environment, despite the fact that the populations to which they belong do not differ, on average. Results are consistent with theory predicting that coexistence depends on competition being stronger within than between species, shown here by analysis of individual-level responses to environmental fluctuation.},
annote = {Considering individual variation and fitness is crucial to understand species coexistence of intense competitors paradoxal at the species level. This is evidenced in this study by mean growth between species being highly similar (not surprisingly with the limited number of resources); whereas growth between individuals are more similar between conspecific than heterospecific, i.e. intraspecific competition is greater than interspecific. Indeed there is no indication that competitors react to neighbors specific identity. Moreover, this analysis highlight that the identified intraspecific variation is not random but structured.},

abstract = {Survival rates of large trees determine forest biomass dynamics. Survival rates of small trees have been linked to mechanisms that maintain biodiversity across tropical forests. How species survival rates change with size offers insight into the links between biodiversity and ecosystem function across tropical forests. We tested patterns of size-dependent tree survival across the tropics using data from 1,781 species and over 2 million individuals to assess whether tropical forests can be characterized by size-dependent life-history survival strategies. We found that species were classifiable into four ‘survival modes' that explain life-history variation that shapes carbon cycling and the relative abundance within forests. Frequently collected functional traits, such as wood density, leaf mass per area and seed mass, were not generally predictive of the survival modes of species. Mean annual temperature and cumulative water deficit predicted the proportion of biomass of survival modes, indicating important links between evolutionary strategies, climate and carbon cycling. The application of survival modes in demographic simulations predicted biomass change across forest sites. Our results reveal globally identifiable size-dependent survival strategies that differ across diverse systems in a consistent way. The abundance of survival modes and interaction with climate ultimately determine forest structure, carbon storage in biomass and future forest trajectories.},

Here we propose that plant functional traits, as determinants of species performance, may be useful tools for quantifying species niche parameters over environmental gradients. Important findingsUnder this framework, the mean trait values of a species determine its niche position along gradients, and intraspecific trait variability determines its niche breadth. This trait-based approach can provide an operational assessment of niche for a potentially large number of species, making it possible to understand and predict species niche shifts under environmental changes. We further advocate a promising method that recently appeared in the literature, which partitions trait diversity into among- and within-community components as a way to quantify the species niche in units of traits instead of environmental parameters. This approach allows the switch of the focus from ecological niches to trait niches, facilitating the examination of species coexistence along undefined environmental gradients. Altogether, the trait-based approach provides a promising toolkit for quantifying the species ecological niche and for understanding the evolution of species niche and traits.},

This study examined the degrees of increase in Narea in response to canopy openings as leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf nitrogen content per mass (N-mass) in saplings of eight deciduous broad-leaved tree species in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Five of the species were well-branched species with a large number of small leaves (lateral-growth type), and the other three species were less-branched species with a small number of large leaves (vertical-growth type). The degrees of increase in Narea were compared between the two crown types. In closed-canopy conditions, leaves of the vertical-growth species tended to have a lower LMA and higher N-mass than those of the lateral-growth species, which resulted in similar N-area for both. LMA increased in canopy openings in the eight species, and the degrees of increase were not largely different between the lateral- and vertical-growth species. On the contrary, N-mass was unchanged in canopy openings in the eight species. As a result, N-area of each species increased in canopy openings in proportion to the increase in LMA, and the degrees of increase in N-area were similar in the lateral- and vertical-growth species. Therefore, this study showed that the degrees of increase in N-area were not correlated with the crown architecture (i.e., the lateral- and vertical-growth types).},

abstract = {Background: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is one of the algorithms of the Markov chain Monte Carlo method that uses Hamiltonian dynamics to propose samples that follow a target distribution. The method can avoid the random walk behavior to achieve a more effective and consistent exploration of the probability space and sensitivity to correlated parameters, which are shortcomings that plague many Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. However, the performance of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is highly sensitive to two hyperparameters. The No-U-Turn Sampler, an extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, was recently introduced to automate the tuning of these hyperparameters. Thus, this study compared the performances of Gibbs sampling, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and the No-U-Turn Sampler for estimating genetic parameters and breeding values as well as sampling qualities in both simulated and real pig data. For all datasets, we used a pedigree-based univariate linear mixed model. Results: For all datasets, the No-U-Turn Sampler and Gibbs sampling performed comparably regarding the estimation of heritabilities and accuracies of breeding values. Compared with Gibbs sampling, the estimates of effective sample sizes for simulated and pig data with the No-U-Turn Sampler were 3.2 to 22.6 and 3.5 to 5.9 times larger, respectively. Autocorrelations decreased more quickly with the No-U-Turn Sampler than with Gibbs sampling. When true heritability was low in the simulated data, the skewness of the marginal posterior distributions with the No-U-Turn Sampler was smaller than that with Gibbs sampling. The performance of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for sampling quality was inferior to that of No-U-Turn Sampler in the simulated data. Moreover, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo could not estimate genetic parameters because of difficulties with the hyperparameter settings with pig data. Conclusions: The No-U-Turn Sampler is a promising sampling method for animal breeding because of its good sampling qualities: large effective sample sizes, low autocorrelations, and low skewness of marginal posterior distributions, particularly when heritability is low. Meanwhile, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo failed to converge with a simple univariate model for pig data. Thus, it might be difficult to use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for usual complex models in animal breeding.},

abstract = {Community assembly processes are thought to shape the mean, spread, and spacing of functional trait values within communities. Two broad categories of assembly processes have been proposed: first, a habitat filter that restricts the range of viable strategies and second, a partitioning of microsites and/or resources that leads to a limit to the similarity of coexisting species. The strength of both processes may be dependent on conditions at a particular site and may change along an abiotic gradient. We sampled environmental variables and plant communities in 44 plots across the varied topography of a coastal California landscape. We characterized 14 leaf, stem, and root traits for 54 woody plant species, including detailed intraspecific data for two traits with the goal of understanding the connection between traits and assembly processes in a variety of environmental conditions. We examined the within-community mean, range, variance, kurtosis, and other measures of spacing of trait values. In this landscape, there was a topographically mediated gradient in water availability. Across this gradient we observed strong shifts in both the plot-level mean trait values and the variation in trait values within communities. Trends in trait means with the environment were due largely to species turnover, with intraspecific shifts playing a smaller role. Traits associated with a vertical partitioning of light showed a greater range and variance on the wet soils, while nitrogen per area, which is associated with water use efficiency, showed a greater spread on the dry soils. We found strong nonrandom patterns in the trait distributions consistent with expectations based on trait-mediated community assembly. There was a significant reduction in the range of six out of 11 leaf and stem functional trait values relative to a null model. For specific leaf area (SLA) we found a significant even spacing of trait values relative to the null model. For seed size we found a more platykurtic distribution than expected. These results suggest that both a habitat filter and a limit to the similarity of coexisting species can simultaneously shape the distribution of traits and the assembly of local plant communities.},

A wide ecological literature supports that these species-specific responses can arise from factors related to life strategies, evolutionary history and intraspecific variation, and also from environmental variation in space and time. In the light of recent advances from coexistence theory combined with mechanistic explanations of diversity maintenance, we discuss how global change drivers can influence species coexistence. We revise the importance of both competition and facilitation for understanding coexistence in different ecosystems, address the influence of phylogenetic relatedness, functional traits, phenotypic plasticity and intraspecific variability, and discuss lessons learnt from invasion ecology. While most previous studies have focused their efforts on disentangling the mechanisms that maintain the biological diversity in species-rich ecosystems such as tropical forests, grasslands and coral reefs, we argue that much can be learnt frompauci-specific communities where functional variability within each species, together with demographic and stochastic processes becomes key to understand species interactions and eventually community responses to global change.},

@article{Watson2016,
abstract = {In plants, gametogenesis occurs late in development, and somatic mutations can therefore be transmitted to the next generation. Longer periods of growth are believed to result in an increase in the number of cell divisions before gametogenesis, with a concomitant increase in mutations arising due to replication errors. However, there is little experimental evidence addressing how many cell divisions occur before gametogenesis. Here, we measured loss of telomeric DNA and accumulation of replication errors in Arabidopsis with short and long life spans to determine the number of replications in lineages leading to gametes. Surprisingly, the number of cell divisions within the gamete lineage is nearly independent of both life span and vegetative growth. One consequence of the relatively stable number of replications per generation is that older plants may not pass along more somatically acquired mutations to their offspring. We confirmed this hypothesis by genomic sequencing of progeny from young and old plants. This independence can be achieved by hierarchical arrangement of cell divisions in plant meristems where vegetative growth is primarily accomplished by expansion of cells in rapidly dividing meristematic zones, which are only rarely refreshed by occasional divisions of more quiescent cells. We support this model by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine retention experiments in shoot and root apical meristems. These results suggest that stem-cell organization has independently evolved in plants and animals to minimize mutations by limiting DNA replication.},

abstract = {{\"{i}}¿½ 2015 Beheregaray, Cooke, Chao and Landguth. Evolution creates and sustains biodiversity via adaptive changes in ecologically relevant traits. Ecologically mediated selection contributes to genetic divergence both in the presence or absence of geographic isolation between populations, and is considered an important driver of speciation. Indeed, the genetics of ecological speciation is becoming increasingly studied across a variety of taxa and environments. In this paper we review the literature of ecological speciation in the tropics. We report on low research productivity in tropical ecosystems and discuss reasons accounting for the rarity of studies. We argue for research programs that simultaneously address biogeographical and taxonomic questions in the tropics, while effectively assessing relationships between reproductive isolation and ecological divergence. To contribute toward this goal, we propose a new framework for ecological speciation that integrates information from phylogenetics, phylogeography, population genomics, and simulations in evolutionary landscape genetics (ELG). We introduce components of the framework, describe ELG simulations (a largely unexplored approach in ecological speciation), and discuss design and experimental feasibility within the context of tropical research. We then use published genetic datasets from populations of five codistributed Amazonian fish species to assess the performance of the framework in studies of tropical speciation. We suggest that these approaches can assist in distinguishing the relative contribution of natural selection from biogeographic history in the origin of biodiversity, even in complex ecosystems such as Amazonia. We also discuss on how to assess ecological speciation using ELG simulations that include selection. These integrative frameworks have considerable potential to enhance conservation management in biodiversity rich ecosystems and to complement historical biogeographic and evolutionary studies of tropical biotas.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Patterns of species co-existence and species diversity in plant communities remain an important research area despite over a century of intensive scrutiny. To provide mechanistic insight into the rules governing plant species co-existence and diversity, plant community ecologists are increasingly quantifying functional trait values for the species found in a wide range of communities. 2. Despite the promise of a quantitative functional trait approach to plant community ecology, we suggest that, along with examining trait variation across species, an assessment of trait variation within species should also be a key component of a trait-based approach to community ecology. Variability within and between individuals and populations is likely widespread due to plastic responses to highly localized abiotic and biotic interactions. 3. In this study, we quantify leaf trait variation within and across ten co-existing tree species in a dry tropical forest in Costa Rica to ask: (i) whether the majority of trait variation is located between species, within species, within individuals or within the leaves themselves; (ii) whether trait values collected using standardized methods correlate with those collected using unstandardized methods; and (iii) to what extent can we differentiate plant species on the basis of their traits? 4. We find that the majority of variation in traits was often explained by between species differences; however, between leaflet trait variation was very high for compound-leaved species. We also show that many species are difficult to reliably differentiate on the basis of functional traits even when sampling many individuals. 5. We suggest an ideal sample size of at least 10, and ideally 20, individuals be used when calculating mean trait values for individual species for entire communities, though even at large sample sizes, it remains unclear if community level trait values will allow comparisons on a larger geographic scale or if species traits are generally similar across scales. It will thus be critical to account for intraspecific variation by comparing species mean trait values across space in multiple microclimatic environments within local communities and along environmental gradients. Further, quantifying trait variability due to plasticity and inheritance will provide a better understanding of the underlying patterns and drivers of trait variation as well as the application of functional traits in outlining mechanisms of species co-existence.},
